## Current Questions:

3. Does our folder structure have duplicates or need cleaning?
4. What are Goose best practices for multi-agent systems?

## Requested Analysis:
- Research official Goose documentation on .goose directory contents
- Analyze our current recipe placement and structure
- Identify any duplicate or unnecessary files
- Provide specific recommendations for improvement" > GOOSE_ANALYSIS_REQUEST.md
