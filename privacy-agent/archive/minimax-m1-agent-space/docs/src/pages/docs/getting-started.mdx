# Getting Started with Privacy SDK

Welcome to Privacy SDK! This guide will help you get up and running with the unified Web3 privacy interface in just a few minutes.

## What is Privacy SDK?

Privacy SDK is a TypeScript library that provides a unified interface for interacting with multiple Web3 privacy protocols. Instead of learning different APIs for each privacy system, you can use one consistent interface to work with Railgun, Mina, Semaphore, and other privacy protocols.

## Key Features

- **Unified Interface**: One API for multiple privacy protocols
- **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- **Plugin Architecture**: Easily extensible with new privacy providers
- **Recipe System**: Pre-built solutions for common privacy operations
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with any JavaScript/TypeScript framework

## Installation

Install Privacy SDK using your preferred package manager:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install @privacy-sdk/core

# Using yarn
yarn add @privacy-sdk/core

# Using pnpm
pnpm add @privacy-sdk/core
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example to get you started with a private token transfer:

```typescript
import { PrivacySDK, RailgunProvider } from '@privacy-sdk/core';

// 1. Initialize the SDK
const sdk = new PrivacySDK();

// 2. Configure and register a privacy provider
const railgunProvider = new RailgunProvider({
  network: 'ethereum',
  rpcUrl: process.env.ETHEREUM_RPC_URL,
  railgunApiUrl: 'https://api.railgun.org'
});

// 3. Register the provider
await sdk.registerProvider('railgun', railgunProvider);

// 4. Perform a private transfer
const transferResult = await sdk.recipes.privateTransfer({
  provider: 'railgun',
  amount: '1.0',
  token: '0xA0b86a33E6441e6D6e35e5c73Ff3CB8dFc5C5C11', // Token contract address
  from: '0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D4A2D51b4FC44C1b',  // Sender address
  to: '0x8ba1f109551bD432803012645Hac136c73F8291e'    // Recipient address
});

console.log('Private transfer completed:', transferResult.transactionId);
```

## Core Concepts

Before diving deeper, it's important to understand the key concepts:

### Privacy SDK Class

The main entry point that manages providers and provides access to recipes.

### Providers

Provider plugins that implement the `PrivacyProvider` interface for specific privacy protocols:

- **RailgunProvider**: For Ethereum-based private transactions
- **MinaProvider**: For Mina protocol zkApps
- **SemaphoreProvider**: For anonymous signaling and voting

### Recipes

Pre-built solutions for common privacy operations:

- **PrivateTransfer**: Send tokens privately
- **PrivateSwap**: Exchange tokens without revealing amounts
- **AnonymousVoting**: Participate in votes anonymously
