{"extracted_information": "Namada is a plug-and-play privacy layer for Web3, designed as a shielded asset hub that rewards users for protecting the multichain. It enables users to protect personal data when using assets, dApps, and blockchains, offering state-of-the-art data protection guarantees. Users can choose between transparent and shielded balances and actions. Namada's approach consolidates assets fragmented across different blockchains into a unified shielded set, supporting any asset and enabling shielded cross-chain interactions. Its 'Shielded Actions' feature allows for confidential and secure cross-chain DeFi interactions, safeguarding personally identifiable information even when interacting with transparent blockchains and applications. Through IBC interoperability, Namada seamlessly connects with Cosmos blockchains and will soon support Ethereum and Solana, enabling private transactions across transparent chains. The network operates on a proof-of-stake system where users can stake NAM to help secure the network.", "specifications": {"type": "Shielded Asset Hub", "privacy_layer_model": "Plug-and-play", "interoperability": "IBC protocol (Cosmos, upcoming Ethereum/Solana)", "consensus_mechanism": "Proof-of-Stake"}, "features": [{"name": "Composable Privacy Layer", "description": "A foundational layer for building privacy-preserving applications in Web3."}, {"name": "Unified Shielded Set", "description": "Consolidates assets from various blockchains into a single, private hub.
