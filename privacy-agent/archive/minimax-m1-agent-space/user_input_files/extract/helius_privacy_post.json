{"extracted_information": "Comparison of Elusiv and Light Protocol:\n\n**Overview:**\n- **Elusiv:** A blockchain-based, zero-knowledge privacy protocol offering universal encryption primarily for private token transfers on Solana.\n- **Light Protocol:** A next-gen zkLayer on Solana enabling private program execution directly on Solana, focusing on private state and UTXO model.\n\n**API Structure:**\n- **Elusiv:** Interacts with a predefined smart contract. API calls are straightforward (e.g., `Elusiv.getElusivInstance`, `elusiv.buildSendTx`, `elusiv.sendElusivTx`). Focuses on topping up a shared private balance and sending transactions.\n- **Light Protocol:** Features a complex, highly modular initialization process involving `TestRelayer`, `LightProvider`, and `User` instances. Allows creation of custom Private Solana Programs (PSPs). API calls involve `user.shield` and `user.transfer` after extensive setup.\n\n**SDK Availability:**\n- **Elusiv:** Provides a TypeScript SDK (`@elusiv/sdk`).\n- **Light Protocol:** Offers a `zk.js` module (`@lightprotocol/zk.js`) and a Light Protocol CLI.\n\n**Ease of Integration:**\n- **Elusiv:** Considered simpler for adding a layer of privacy for token transfers, especially on devnet/mainnet. Interacts with a single predefined smart contract.\n- **Light Protocol:** Described as having a complex initialization process. Recommended for applications requiring granular control over privacy features and encryption of specific parts of the application state due to its modularity and flexibility.\n\n**Documentation Quality:**\n- **Elusiv:** Documentation includes 'Elusiv Docs', 'Elusiv SDK', and 'Elusiv Samples'.\n- **Light Protocol:** Documentation includes 'Light Protocol Docs', 'zk.js', and 'Private Solana Program Example Implementations', with tutorials for creating custom PSPs.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- **Elusiv:** Enables universal encryption; users maintain control over their data; leverages a shared pool model for enhanced anonymity with scale; currently deployed and usable on devnet/mainnet.\n- **Light Protocol:** Allows private program execution directly on Solana; supports private state, UTXO model, and on-chain verification of private state transitions; offers granular control over privacy features; enables creation of custom Private Solana Programs (PSPs); provides a flexible workflow for managing multiple users.\n\n**Limitations:**\n- **Elusiv:** While improving with scale, initial deposits to and payments from the shared pool can still be observed.\n- **Light Protocol:** Requires a complex initialization setup; not deployed on devnet/mainnet (as of the article's writing), necessitating a local `test-validator` for development; involves relayers for transaction processing, which incur a fee (100,000 Lamports per transaction)."}
