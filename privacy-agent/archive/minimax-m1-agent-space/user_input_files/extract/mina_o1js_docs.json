{"extracted_information": "o1js is a TypeScript library for writing general-purpose zero-knowledge (zk) programs and zk smart contracts for Mina. It functions as an embedded domain-specific language (DSL) within plain TypeScript, allowing code to be executed as normal TypeScript while providing provable data types and methods. Proofs generated are zero-knowledge, verifiable without revealing inputs or execution traces, with options to make select parts public. It's a general-purpose zk framework with a rich set of built-in provable operations including basic arithmetic, hashing, signatures, boolean operations, and comparisons. It enables writing zkApps on Mina, which are client-side smart contracts with private inputs.
