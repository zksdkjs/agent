### Integration Patterns

1. **Contract Development**
   ```solidity
   // SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause-Clear
   pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
   
   import "fhevm/abstracts/EIP712WithModifier.sol";
   import "fhevm/lib/TFHE.sol";
   
   contract PrivateToken is EIP712WithModifier {
       // Encrypted balances
       mapping(address => euint32) private balances;
       
       // Transfer tokens with encrypted amounts
       function transfer(address to, bytes calldata encryptedAmount) public {
           euint32 amount = TFHE.asEuint32(encryptedAmount);
           euint32 fromBalance = balances[msg.sender];
           euint32 toBalance = balances[to];
           
           // This will revert if fromBalance < amount
           balances[msg.sender] = TFHE.sub(fromBalance, amount);
           balances[to] = TFHE.add(toBalance, amount);
       }
       
       // Get balance (only the caller can decrypt)
       function getBalance() public view onlySignedPublicKey(msg.sender) returns (bytes memory) {
           return TFHE.reencrypt(balances[msg.sender], msg.sender);
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Client-Side Integration**
   ```typescript
   import { createFhevmInstance, encryptAndSign } from 'fhevmjs';
   
   // Initialize FHEVM client
   const fhevm = await createFhevmInstance({ chainId, provider });
   await fhevm.generateKeys();
   
   // Encrypt data for on-chain use
   const encryptedAmount = await fhevm.encrypt(1000);
   
   // Interact with private contract
   const tx = await privateToken.transfer(recipientAddress, encryptedAmount);
   await tx.wait();
   
   // Decrypt authorized data
   const encryptedBalance = await privateToken.getBalance();
   const balance = await fhevm.decrypt(encryptedBalance);
   console.log(`Your balance: ${balance}`);
   ```

3. **Composability Pattern**
   ```solidity
   // Composing private contracts
   contract PrivateDEX {
       PrivateToken public tokenA;
       PrivateToken public tokenB;
       
       // Swap tokens with hidden amounts
       function swap(bytes calldata encryptedAmountA) public {
           euint32 amountA = TFHE.asEuint32(encryptedAmountA);
           // Calculate swap amount based on private formula
           euint32 amountB = calculateSwapAmount(amountA);
           
           // Execute transfers with encrypted amounts
           tokenA.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), TFHE.encrypt(amountA));
           tokenB.transfer(msg.sender, TFHE.encrypt(amountB));
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Common Operations**
   - Key generation and management
   - Encrypted data preparation
   - Confidential transaction creation and submission
   - Authorized decryption of results

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Abstract away FHE complexity

   - Handle key management securely

### Example Interface

```typescript
// Hypothetical SDK interface for FHEVM
class FhevmProvider implements PrivacyProvider {
  async initialize() {
    // Set up FHEVM client and generate keys
  }
  
  async createAccount() {
    // Handle account and key generation
  }
  
  async deployPrivacyContract(contractCode, parameters) {
    // Deploy a confidential contract with FHEVM capabilities
  }
  
  async executeConfidentialTransaction(contract, method, params, encryptedParams) {
    // Execute transaction with encrypted parameters
  }
  
  async encryptData(data, type) {
    // Encrypt data for on-chain use with appropriate FHE type
  }
  
  async decryptAuthorizedData(encryptedData) {
    // Decrypt data that the user is authorized to view
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Zama's FHEVM represents a significant advancement in blockchain privacy technology, offering a framework for confidential smart contracts that maintain end-to-end encryption while preserving EVM compatibility. The use of Fully Homomorphic Encryption enables a new paradigm of privacy where computations can be performed directly on encrypted data.

The combination of strong privacy guarantees with familiar Solidity development creates a compelling option for developers looking to add confidentiality to their blockchain applications without sacrificing composability or requiring users to learn new programming models.

For our unified SDK, FHEVM represents an important provider option, especially for applications that require complex confidential computations or need to maintain EVM compatibility. Its integration will give developers a powerful tool for building privacy-preserving applications with strong cryptographic guarantees.
