# Aztec Provider Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of a real Aztec provider for the Privacy SDK, replacing the current stub implementation with a functional version that uses the official Aztec SDK (@aztec/aztec.js). The implementation will focus on integrating with Aztec's Private Execution Environment (PXE) and supporting key privacy operations.

## Dependencies

We'll need to add the following Aztec packages to our SDK:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@aztec/accounts": "^1.2.0",
    "@aztec/aztec.js": "^1.2.0",
    "@aztec/noir-contracts.js": "^1.2.0",
    "@aztec/pxe": "^1.2.0",
    "@aztec/stdlib": "^1.2.0"
  }
}
```

## Implementation Steps

### 1. PXE Integration (5 days)

#### 1.1 Create PXE Service Module
- Implement a PXE service wrapper that manages PXE lifecycle
- Create PXE configuration utilities
- Add connection management for Aztec node

#### 1.2 Account Management
- Implement Schnorr account creation and management
- Add key derivation and storage utilities
- Create address management features

#### 1.3 PXE Integration Tests
- Create tests for PXE initialization
- Test account creation and management
- Test PXE service lifecycle

### 2. Core Provider Implementation (7 days)

#### 2.1 Update AztecProvider Class
- Replace stub implementation with real functionality
- Integrate PXE service for privacy operations
- Implement proper error handling

#### 2.2 Transaction Management
- Implement private transaction submission
- Add transaction tracking and status updates
- Create fee estimation and management

#### 2.3 Balance and History Features
- Implement private balance retrieval
- Add transaction history functionality
- Create balance tracking utilities

### 3. Noir Contract Integration (5 days)

#### 3.1 Contract Interface
- Create a generic interface for Noir contracts
- Implement contract deployment utilities
- Add contract interaction methods

#### 3.2 Privacy Operation Mapping
- Map SDK operations to Noir contract calls
- Implement privacy-preserving method calls
- Add nullifier management for transactions

#### 3.3 Contract Tests
- Test contract deployment
- Test contract interaction
- Test privacy guarantees

### 4. Recipe Integration (3 days)

#### 4.1 Recipe Support
- Update existing recipes to work with Aztec provider
- Optimize for Aztec-specific features
- Add Aztec-specific validation

#### 4.2 Recipe Tests
- Test all recipes with Aztec provider
- Create Aztec-specific test cases
- Measure performance with Aztec

### 5. Testing and Documentation (5 days)

#### 5.1 Unit Tests
- Create comprehensive test suite for Aztec provider
- Test all provider methods
- Test error cases and edge conditions

#### 5.2 Integration Tests
- Test with Aztec testnet
- Test cross-provider operations
- Performance benchmarking

#### 5.3 Documentation
- Create Aztec provider integration guide
- Document Aztec-specific features
- Update existing documentation

## Technical Challenges

1. **PXE Setup Complexity**: The PXE requires specific setup and lifecycle management.
2. **Nullifier Management**: Proper handling of nullifiers is critical for privacy.
3. **Account Deployment**: Aztec accounts need to be deployed unlike Ethereum accounts.
4. **Contract Interaction**: Managing Noir contract interactions requires specialized code.
5. **Network Compatibility**: Ensuring compatibility with Aztec testnet and eventually mainnet.

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Complete PXE integration and basic provider implementation
- **Week 2**: Implement Noir contract integration and update recipes
- **Week 3**: Finalize testing and documentation

## Success Criteria

1. All existing tests pass with the Aztec provider
2. Provider successfully connects to Aztec testnet
3. All recipes work with the Aztec provider
4. Documentation is complete and accurate
5. Performance is within acceptable limits

## Next Steps After Implementation

1. Consider additional Aztec-specific recipes
2. Optimize for production deployment
3. Add support for advanced Aztec features
4. Implement cross-provider compatibility improvements
