## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### NPM Package Structure
```
@privacy-sdk/core
â”œâ”€â”€ dist/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ esm/          # ES modules
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cjs/          # CommonJS
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ types/        # TypeScript definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/         # Base interfaces and classes
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ providers/    # Provider implementations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ recipes/      # Pre-built privacy patterns
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/        # Utilities and helpers
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ types/        # TypeScript type definitions
â””â”€â”€ examples/         # Usage examples
```

### Target API Design
```typescript
// Simple initialization
const privacy = new PrivacySDK({
  defaultProvider: 'railgun',
  providers: {
    railgun: { networkName: 'ethereum' },
    aztec: { networkId: 'aztec-testnet' }
  }
})

// Recipe-based usage (recommended)
await privacy.recipes.privateTransfer({
  to: '0x...',
  amount: '1000000000000000000',
  token: 'ETH'
})

// Direct provider access (advanced)
const railgun = privacy.getProvider('railgun')
await railgun.sendPrivateTransaction({...})
```

### Quality Gates (Must Pass Before Release)
1. **Test Coverage**: >90% code coverage with integration tests
2. **Performance**: <5s proof generation for standard transfers
3. **Security**: External security audit completed
4. **Documentation**: Complete API docs with examples
5. **Compatibility**: Works in Node.js, browsers, and React Native

### Success Metrics
- **v1.0.0 Release**: NPM package published with stable API
- **Developer Adoption**: >100 GitHub stars within 30 days
- **Integration**: >5 projects using the SDK in production
- **Provider Ecosystem**: >3 community-contributed providers

   - [ ] Add Shield/Unshield recipes for publicâ†”private token conversion
   - [ ] Create BatchTransfer recipe for multiple transfers in one transaction
   - [ ] Implement PrivateNFT recipes for NFT privacy operations
   - [ ] Add CrossProvider recipe compatibility system

2. **STEP 2.8: Documentation Update** - Reflect current progress
   - [ ] Update PROJECT_STATUS.md with latest Sprint 2 achievements
   - [ ] Enhance HANDOVER_GUIDE.md with new recipe implementations

## RISK MANAGEMENT

### Technical Risks
- **Provider API Changes**: Pin specific versions, create adapter layers
- **Performance Issues**: Early benchmarking, proof caching strategies
- **Browser Compatibility**: Comprehensive testing, polyfill strategies

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Strict Sprint boundaries, defer non-critical features
- **Provider Integration Complexity**: Start with Railgun (known good), Aztec as secondary
- **Testing Coverage**: Automated testing from day 1, not as afterthought

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Weekly Sprint Reviews**: Adjust scope based on progress
- **Community Feedback**: Early alpha releases for feedback
- **Documentation First**: Write docs as features are built, not after
