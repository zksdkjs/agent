## SPRINT RETROSPECTIVE (End of Sprint 1)

### What Went Well?
- Completed the entire Sprint 1 scope ahead of schedule
- Successfully implemented core architecture with plugin system
- Added Railgun provider implementation plus Aztec stub
- Achieved TypeScript type safety throughout the codebase
- Build system working correctly with ESM and CJS outputs

### What Could Be Improved?
- Need more comprehensive automated tests
- Documentation could be more detailed, especially for provider integration
- Error handling could be more specific in some areas
- Missing real-world testing on actual blockchain networks

### Action Items from Sprint 1
1. ‚úÖ Implement comprehensive test suite with high coverage
2. ‚úÖ Connect Railgun provider to actual Railgun SDK
3. ‚è≥ Test on Ethereum testnet to validate functionality
4. üîÑ Enhance documentation with detailed integration guides
5. ‚úÖ Add support for more recipe types beyond privateTransfer

## SPRINT PROGRESS (Sprint 3)

### Current Status
- Completed research on Aztec PXE integration
- Implemented core services for Aztec provider:
  - PXE Service: Manages Private eXecution Environment lifecycle
  - Account Service: Handles Schnorr account creation and management
  - Contract Service: Supports Noir contract deployment and interaction
- Updated Aztec provider with real implementation using services
- Created example for basic Aztec usage
- Created developer blogs documenting the journey

### Challenges
- PXE setup and lifecycle management is complex
- Account deployment requires careful error handling
- Contract interactions need standardized patterns
- Testing with testnet requires proper configuration
- Balancing flexibility with abstraction in the provider

### Next Steps
- Complete testing with Aztec testnet
- Add comprehensive test suite for all services
- Finalize documentation for Aztec provider
- Optimize performance for production use
- Ensure all recipes work with Aztec provider
