{"extracted_information": "The WEB CONTENT is the 'Welcome | Mina Documentation' page, which serves as an entry point to various aspects of the Mina Protocol. It highlights Mina as a Layer-1 blockchain featuring zero-knowledge smart contracts ('zkApps'). The content strongly points towards developer resources for building with zkApps, implying the availability of developer tools and frameworks. While direct API structures or explicit SDK names are not detailed on this specific page, the documentation outlines the path for developers to learn about and build zkApps, which are central to Mina's privacy capabilities.", "specifications": {}, "pricing": {}, "features": [{"name": "Zero-Knowledge Smart Contracts (zkApps)", "description": "Mina is a Layer-1 blockchain with zero-knowledge smart contracts ('zkApps') that enable private computation and verifiable transactions.
