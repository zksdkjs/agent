# Elusiv
Scaling privacy with Zero-knowledge proofs and MPC on the [Solana](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana) blockchain.

## Programs
This repository contains a collection of on-chain programs:

- the [Elusiv](./elusiv/) on-chain program,
- the [Elusiv-Warden-Network](./elusiv-warden-network/) on-chain program.

The addresses for the on-chain programs are located in (and linked at compilation from) [Id.toml](./Id.toml).

## Supported tokens
All tokens (SOL and SPL-tokens) supported by the Elusiv on-chain programs are located in (and linked at compilation from) [Token.toml](./Token.toml).
On-chain price data is provided through the [Pyth oracle network](https://pyth.network/).

## Development
Please ensure that you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and the [Solana tool suite](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools) installed on your local machine.

### Building
The `build` crate allows for accessible building and testing of any program in this repository.
Build a program library with:

```
$ sh build.sh build --cluster <mainnet|devnet> --target <program-name>
```

### Testing
This library comes with comprehensive unit and integration tests for each of the provided crates.
Execute the tests with:

```
$ sh build.sh test --test-kind <unit|integration|...> --target <program-name>
```

### Using Docker
Testing can be performed in a Docker container using `./docker_test.sh`. Running this will result in the creation of an `elusiv-dev` Docker image as well as a few cache volumes. 

### Program interaction
In order to easily interact with the program from a Rust client, import a program library with the `elusiv-client` feature enabled.
This results in access to all instruction-generation functions located in each program-crate's `instructions` module.

When constructing instructions from other clients, serialize the instructions using [Borsh](https://borsh.io/).

## Contribution
We welcome contributions and pull requests.
Please check our [contribution rules](https://github.com/elusiv-privacy/elusiv/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Security
To ensure that Elusiv is secure we did the following among other things:

- independent security audit of the Elusiv on-chain program with [OtterSec](./resources/OtterSec-09-22.pdf),
- independent security audit of the associated Zero-knowledge-proof circuits with [ABDK Consulting](https://github.com/elusiv-privacy/circuits/tree/master/audits),
- running the [Sec3](https://www.sec3.dev/) X-Ray tool after any changes to the on-chain code,
- open sourced the codebase together with our [security policy](./SECURITY.md).

Our goal is to make the Elusiv on-chain programs non-upgradeable as soon as possible.
