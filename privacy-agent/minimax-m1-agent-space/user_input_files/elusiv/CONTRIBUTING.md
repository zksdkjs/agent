## Pull request guidelines

We appreciate and welcome pull requests to help improve Elusiv. To ensure a successful review process, please make sure your pull request meets the following guidelines:

- Explain clearly what your pull request does and why it is needed. Remember, keep it as short as possible and no shorter. The less time we have to spend guessing your intent, the faster we can get your awesome improvement merged in. If your PR addresses an existing Github issue, make sure to mention it inside.
- Make sure your code adheres to the existing code style of the project.
- Add tests for any new features or changes you have made and make sure all of these pass.
- For assigning a reviewer, generally the original author of the piece of code you're editing is best (you can use `git blame` to determine who that is). Alternatively, feel free to ask for support in our discord server.
