## Key Questions
1. What is the core technology behind each privacy system (e.g., ZK-SNARKs, ZK-STARKs, etc.)?
2. What is the developer experience like for each system?
3. What are the trade-offs between privacy, performance, and cost for each system?
4. Which systems are the most mature and production-ready?
5. What are the common API calls or functions that could be abstracted into a unified interface?

## Resource Strategy
- **Primary data sources**: Official documentation, GitHub repositories, whitepapers, and developer blogs of the respective projects.
- **Search strategies**: Use targeted web searches for each privacy system, focusing on terms like "[system name] developer guide," "[system name] API," "[system name] SDK," "[system name] code examples," and "[system name] security audit."

## Verification Plan
- **Source requirements**: Prioritize official and technical sources.
- **Cross-validation**: Cross-reference information from documentation with GitHub repositories and community discussions (e.g., Discord, Telegram) to verify accuracy and identify potential issues.

## Expected Deliverables
- A comprehensive research report in Markdown format.
- A comparison matrix summarizing the findings.
- Recommended approaches for lightweight integration.
- Common patterns for a unified SDK design.
- Real code examples and API structures from each system.
- Security and production considerations.

## Task type
- **Primary focus**: Search-Focused
- **Justification**: The task requires gathering and synthesizing a large amount of information from various sources to provide a broad overview and comparison of different technologies. While some verification is needed, the primary effort is on comprehensive information gathering.
