# TASK: Build Production-Ready Privacy SDK for Web3 Developers  

## Objective: Create the "LangChain of Privacy" - One Simple Interface for All Privacy Systems

> **See MASTER_PLAN.md for complete tracking and accountability framework**

## CURRENT SPRINT: Phase 1.1 - Current Systems Analysis

**FOCUS**: Deep research and analysis of privacy systems we already have code for

[âœ…] STEP 1: Complete Analysis of Current Systems (THIS WEEK)
  - [âœ…] Railgun: Deep dive into cookbook recipes, Recipe->Step pattern, real integration code
  - [âœ…] Zeto: Circuit implementations, UTXO models, Go SDK vs JS integration patterns  
  - [âœ…] Elusiv: Solana implementation, warden network, sunsetting status analysis
  - [âœ…] Aztec: Noir contracts, PXE, Aztec.js SDK, production timeline

**DELIVERABLE**: Four comprehensive analysis documents with real code examples and developer experience ratings

[ðŸ”„] STEP 2: Extended Privacy Technology Research
  - [âœ…] Mina zkApps: Completed analysis of o1js framework and developer experience
  - [âœ…] Zama FHE: Completed analysis of FHEVM and FHE approach to privacy
  - [âœ…] Penumbra: Completed analysis of Cosmos-based privacy solution
  - [âœ…] Namada: Completed analysis of cross-chain privacy layer
  - [âœ…] IronFish: Completed analysis of privacy-focused cryptocurrency
  - [ ] Midnight (IOG): Research in progress
  - [ ] Chainlink Privacy/DECO: Research in progress
  - [ ] Big Tech privacy solutions (Google, Microsoft, Intel, AWS, Meta)
  - [ ] Create technology comparison matrix

[ ] STEP 3: Design Unified Interface (LangChain Approach)
  - Base provider interface design
  - Plugin architecture like LangChain tools
  - Recipe system for common privacy patterns
  - Simple developer API design

[ ] STEP 4: Implementation Documentation
  - Implementation guides for each chosen technology
  - SDK architecture documentation
  - Plugin development guides

[ ] STEP 5: Actual SDK Implementation
  - Core SDK with plugin system
  - Provider implementations (priority order)
  - Developer tools and examples

## CURRENT TASK: Complete Extended Privacy Technology Research
**NEXT**: Complete analysis of Midnight and Chainlink DECO, then create a comparison matrix of all privacy technologies
