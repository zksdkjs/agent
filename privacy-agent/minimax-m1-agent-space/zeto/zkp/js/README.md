# Zeto toolkit javascript library

The main purpose of the javascript project is initializing the testing environment for the circom-based ZKP circuits. The included test cases demonstrate expected behaviors of the provided circuits, which can be used as a reference to build client implementations for the Zeto toolkit.

# Build

The circuits have already been compiled to WASM based runtime libraries. All the materials are available in order to generate the witness.

On the other hand, proving keys setup has not been performed. You must follow the steps below to generate the proving key, and then export the verification key.

If modifying the circuits, you must go through the full flow of circuit compilation and proving key generation, as well as exporting the verification key and Solidity verifier library.

## Install Pre-requisites

Follow the instructions here to install `circom`, the circuit compiler, and `snarkjs`, the tool to generate proving keys, verification keys and the Solidity library.

[https://docs.circom.io/getting-started/installation/](https://docs.circom.io/getting-started/installation/)

## Compile the circuits and generate verification keys and solidity libraries

1. Install the dependencies of the circuits, by going to the `/zkp/circuits` folder:

```console
cd zkp/circuits/scripts
npm i
```

2. Compile the circuits and generate verification keys and solidity files.

- set where you want to store the generated verification keys and the downloaded PTAU files
  ```console
  export CIRCUITS_ROOT="$HOME/circuits"
  export PROVING_KEYS_ROOT="$HOME/proving-keys"
  export PTAU_DOWNLOAD_PATH="$HOME/ptaus"
  mkdir -p $PROVING_KEYS_ROOT $PTAU_DOWNLOAD_PATH $CIRCUITS_ROOT
  ```
- run the generation script for **ALL** circuits
  ```console
  npm run gen
  ```

  **run `npm run gen -- -c $circuit` for developing a single circuit**

  **run `npm run gen -- -v` to show details outputs of each command**

  **use `GEN_CONCURRENCY` to control how many circuits to be processed in parallel, default to 8**

# Run

Once the proving keys and verification keys are generated, set the environment variable `PROVING_KEYS_ROOT` to the folder that contains the proving keys and verification keys.

```console
$ npm i
$ npm t
