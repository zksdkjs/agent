# 🚀 zkSDK 24/7 Autonomous Development System

> **The world's first 24/7 autonomous privacy SDK development system**

This system uses multiple AI agents working around the clock to build, test, document, and promote the zkSDK privacy infrastructure. It combines Goose framework orchestration with strategically selected AI models for optimal performance.

## 🎯 System Overview

- **Focus**: Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Discord engagement
- **Target**: Daily technical threads, progress updates
- **Speed**: Uses Groq for rapid content generation

### 🎯 **Orchestrator Agent** (Claude) - *Strategic Coordinator*
- **Schedule**: 3x daily (9 AM, 1 PM, 6 PM) 
- **Focus**: Agent coordination, strategic decisions, conflict resolution
- **Target**: Optimal resource allocation and priority management
- **Intelligence**: Uses Claude for complex reasoning

### 🔍 **Research Agent** (Claude) - *Industry Intelligence*
- **Schedule**: Weekly (Mondays)
- **Focus**: Privacy industry analysis, competitive intelligence
- **Target**: "Privacy Week in Review" blog posts
- **Sources**: ArXiv, GitHub, forums, regulatory updates

## 📦 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Goose CLI**: AI agent orchestration framework
- **Python 3.8+**: For automation scripts  
- **API Keys**: At least one of Anthropic, OpenAI, or Groq
- **Node.js**: For zkSDK development (optional for testing)

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone & Navigate**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/minim-max-agent-space/privacy-agent/
   ```

2. **Set API Keys**  
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-claude-key"
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"  
   export GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-key"
   ```

3. **Start System**
   ```bash
   ./start-system.sh
   ```

4. **Choose Mode**
   - **Full System**: All agents running 24/7 (recommended)
   - **Test Single**: Test one agent first
   - **Developer Only**: Just continuous coding

## 📊 Expected Output

### **Daily Deliverables**
- 20-50 git commits from Developer Agent
- 2-10 bug fixes and optimizations
- 3-5 social media posts about progress
- Comprehensive test suite validation
- Daily progress reports

### **Weekly Deliverables**  
- 3-7 major features implemented
- "Privacy Week in Review" industry blog post
- Weekly sprint planning and retrospective
- NPM package releases (when ready)
- Performance benchmarks and metrics

### **Monthly Deliverables**
- 4 NPM releases of @zksdk/core
- 4 comprehensive blog posts
- 100+ commits to codebase  
- 80+ social media engagements
- Complete documentation updates

## 🔧 Configuration

### **Model Assignments**
- **Qwen Coder**: Best for coding tasks (Developer, Tester)
- **Groq**: Fastest for social media and quick tasks
- **Claude**: Best for strategic thinking and complex analysis

### **Recipe Customization**
Each agent has a dedicated recipe file:
- `recipe-developer.yaml`: 24/7 coding configuration
- `recipe-social.yaml`: Social media automation  
- `recipe-research.yaml`: Industry analysis
- `recipe-orchestrator.yaml`: Strategic coordination
- `recipe-tester.yaml`: Quality assurance

### **Schedule Customization**
Edit `scripts/run-24-7.py` to modify:
- Agent execution frequency
- Break durations  
- Focus area rotations
- Priority algorithms

## 📈 Monitoring & Metrics

### **Real-time Monitoring**
- Agent session logs in `outputs/logs/`
- Daily progress reports in `outputs/reports/`
- Session data in `outputs/sessions/`
- Generated content in `outputs/{code,social,blogs}/`

### **Key Metrics Tracked**
- Development velocity (commits/day)
- Code quality (test coverage, bugs)
- Community growth (followers, engagement)
- Content production (blogs, social posts)
- System uptime and reliability

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

### **Manual Agent Control**
```bash
# Run specific agent manually
python3 scripts/run-24-7.py --mode agent --agent developer --focus features

# Generate daily report
python3 scripts/run-24-7.py --mode report

# Test single agent
goose run --recipe recipe-developer.yaml --param focus_mode=bugs
```

### **Custom Parameters**
```bash
# Developer with specific focus
goose run --recipe recipe-developer.yaml --param focus_mode=integrations --param priority_task="aztec-provider"

# Social with content type
goose run --recipe recipe-social.yaml --param content_type=thread --param platform=twitter

# Research with specific focus  
goose run --recipe recipe-research.yaml --param research_focus=academic --param week_theme="zk-rollups"
```

## 🛡️ Security & Best Practices

### **API Key Management**
- Store keys in environment variables, never in code
- Use separate keys for each agent type
- Monitor API usage and costs
- Implement rate limiting

### **Code Quality Gates**
- 90%+ test coverage required
- All tests must pass before deployment
- Security review for privacy-related code
- Performance regression checks

### **Operational Safety**
- Agent failure recovery mechanisms
- Human oversight for critical decisions
- Rollback capabilities for bad deployments
- Cost monitoring and alerts

## 📚 Documentation

- **Agent Recipes**: Individual `.yaml` files with agent configurations
- **System Scripts**: Python automation in `scripts/` directory  
- **Output Tracking**: All generated content saved in `outputs/`
- **Session Logs**: Detailed execution logs for debugging
