# üöÄ QUICK START GUIDE

## THE PROBLEM (What You Were Facing)
- Agents kept restarting from scratch every time
- No memory between sessions - wasting time on basic checks
- Scripts only checked index.ts, missing 900+ lines of completed work
- Agents stopped after a few turns without completing tasks

## THE SOLUTION (What I Built)
A complete session management system that:
- ‚úÖ Remembers previous work and continues from where it left off
- ‚úÖ Tracks actual progress (all files, not just index.ts)
- ‚úÖ Automatically resumes Goose sessions
- ‚úÖ Focuses agents on incomplete work
- ‚úÖ Runs continuously with pause/resume support

## HOW TO USE IT

### Option 1: Run Forever (Recommended)
```bash
./run-forever.sh
```
- Runs continuously until all providers are complete
- Press Ctrl+C to pause, run again to resume
- Shows progress after each cycle

### Option 2: Run for 1 Hour
```bash
./smart-continue-real-hour.sh
```
- Runs for exactly 1 hour with auto-restarts
- Focuses on the highest priority incomplete provider

### Option 3: Work on Specific Provider
```bash
./launch-strategic-system.sh railgun
# or
./launch-strategic-system.sh aztec
```

### Check Progress
```bash
./check-real-status.sh
```

## WHAT HAPPENS NOW

1. **Agents Continue Work**: They read memory files and continue from previous sessions
2. **No More Starting Over**: Session persistence ensures continuity
3. **Smart Priority**: Works on partial implementations first
4. **Automatic Progress**: Each cycle updates the build progress

## CURRENT STATUS
- ‚úÖ FHEVM: Complete (927 lines)
- üöß Railgun: Partial (196 lines) - needs Recipe‚ÜíStep‚ÜíComboMeal pattern
- ‚ùå Light Protocol: Not started
- ‚ùå Aztec: Not started
- ‚ùå Bitcoin: Not started

## NEXT STEPS
Just run:
```bash
./run-forever.sh
```

And let it work! The system will:
1. Complete Railgun implementation
2. Move to Light Protocol
3. Then Aztec
4. Then Bitcoin
5. Show "ALL PROVIDERS COMPLETE!" when done

## MONITORING
Watch the progress in another terminal:
```bash
# Real-time logs
tail -f logs/*_session.log

# Progress tracking
watch -n 5 ./check-real-status.sh
```

That's it! Your agents will now work continuously and effectively! üéâ
