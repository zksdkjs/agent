# Current Sprint - zkSDK Development

## 🎯 Sprint Goal
Complete PM Market Research and decide SDK scope (Transfer-only vs Full DeFi)

## ✅ Completed Today (Oct 23, 2025)
- [x] Created Framework V2 structure
- [x] Migrated all files to new organization
- [x] Created PM research recipe with web search
- [x] Set up documentation (HOW-IT-WORKS.md, QUICK-REFERENCE.md)
- [x] Created Goose agent rules (.goose/RULES.md)
- [x] Updated README with new structure

## 🔄 Active Tasks
- [ ] Run PM market research to understand developer needs
- [ ] Analyze what features developers actually need:
  - Just transfers?
  - Full DeFi (swaps, lending, staking)?
  - Contract interactions?
- [ ] Research Privacy Cash SDK (Solana) real usage
- [ ] Research Railgun DeFi capabilities
- [ ] Research Aztec production applications
- [ ] Update strategy based on research findings
- [ ] Decide: Transfer-only MVP or Full DeFi SDK?

## 📊 Current SDK Status
- **Providers Complete**: 3/5 (60%)
  - ✅ Railgun (transfer only)
  - ✅ Aztec (has contract methods)
  - ✅ Privacy Cash SDK (Solana)
  - ⏳ Bitcoin (not started)
  - ⏳ FHEVM (deprioritized)
- **Interface**: Limited to transfers only
- **Frontend**: No unified interface yet

## 🚫 Blockers
- Don't know what developers ACTUALLY need (need research)
- BasePrivacyProvider interface too limited?
- Each provider needs different wallet setup

## 🎯 Next Session
1. Kick off automation: `./automation/scripts/daily-run-strategy.sh`
2. Review findings in `insights/research/`
3. Make data-driven decision on SDK scope
4. Update strategy based on findings

## 💡 Key Questions to Answer
1. What are developers building with privacy protocols?
2. Do they need just transfers or full DeFi?
3. How important is unified wallet interface?
4. Should we ship MVP or wait for full features?

## 📝 Notes
- We're "The LangChain of Privacy" - need to be as easy as LangChain
- Privacy Cash SDK is for SOLANA (not "Light Protocol")
- We integrate WITH MetaMask/WalletConnect, not against them
- User emphasized: Make it easy for frontend devs
