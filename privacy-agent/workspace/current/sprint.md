## 🚫 Current Blockers

### Technical Issues
- ❌ Wallet-connect tests failing (dependency resolution)
- ❌ Recipe tests failing (src/dist type conflicts)
- ❌ FHEVM tests failing (network connectivity)
- ⚠️ Test coverage at 43.7% (need 90%)

### Open Questions
- Need market research data on developer needs
- Decide: Transfer-only MVP or Full DeFi SDK?

## 🎯 Next Actions
1. **Fix failing tests** → Get all tests passing
2. **Run example writer** → Create usage examples
3. **Generate daily report** → Document today's progress
4. **Improve coverage** → Target 90% across all packages

## 💡 Recent Decisions
- ✅ Built unified wallet interface (zkWalletConnect)
- ✅ Auto-detection of available providers
- ✅ Core package fully tested (100% coverage)
- ✅ Pipeline automation improved (test-writer integration)

## 📝 Notes
- We're "The LangChain of Privacy" - need to be as easy as LangChain
- Privacy Cash SDK is for SOLANA (not "Light Protocol")
- We integrate WITH MetaMask/WalletConnect, not against them
- User emphasized: Make it easy for frontend devs
- **NEW:** zkWalletConnect solves the "different wallet setup" problem
