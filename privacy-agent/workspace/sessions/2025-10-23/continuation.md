# Session Continuation Guide - Oct 23, 2025

## ‚úÖ Work Completed Today
1. **Framework V2 Migration** - Complete reorganization for sustainability
2. **PM Research System** - Created recipe with web search capabilities
3. **Documentation** - HOW-IT-WORKS.md, QUICK-REFERENCE.md, Goose rules
4. **Structure** - All files migrated to new organized structure

## üìç Current State
- Framework V2 is live and organized
- PM research recipe ready to run (`recipe-privacy-cash-researcher.yaml`)
- SDK at 60% complete (3/5 providers)
- Waiting on market research to decide scope

## üéØ Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Run PM Market Research (CRITICAL)
```bash
cd /Users/saeeddawod/Desktop/agent/privacy-agent
./automation/scripts/run-pm-research.sh
```
This will:
- Research real developer usage of Privacy Cash SDK, Railgun, Aztec
- Search GitHub for actual implementations
- Analyze DeFi integrations
- Create report in `insights/research/`

### 2. Review Research Findings
```bash
# Check the generated report
cat insights/research/market/pm-market-research-*.md
```

### 3. Make Strategic Decision
Based on research, decide:
- **Option A**: Ship transfer-only SDK (fast, limited)
- **Option B**: Build full DeFi features (slower, valuable)
- **Option C**: Phased approach (ship MVP, add features)

### 4. Update Strategy
```bash
# Create new strategy based on findings
vim strategy/active/v3-strategy-2025-10-24.md
```

### 5. Execute Development
Depending on decision:
- If A: Run `recipe-wallet-connect-system.yaml`
- If B: Run `recipe-developer.yaml` with DeFi focus
- If C: Create phased release plan

## üîß Commands to Continue

```bash
# Start tomorrow's session
cd /Users/saeeddawod/Desktop/agent/privacy-agent
./automation/scripts/start-new-session.sh

# Check current status
cat workspace/current/sprint.md

# Run PM research (if not done)
./automation/scripts/run-pm-research.sh

# Or continue with existing Goose session
goose session list
goose session --resume --name pm_research_[TIMESTAMP]
```

## üí≠ Strategic Context
The critical question: **What do developers ACTUALLY need?**

We have 3 working providers but only basic transfer support. The research will tell us if that's enough or if we need DeFi capabilities (swaps, lending, contract calls).

Remember:
- Privacy Cash SDK = Solana (not "Privacy Cash")
- We're building "The LangChain of Privacy"
- Frontend devs need simple integration
- We complement MetaMask/WalletConnect, not compete

## üìä Success Criteria for Tomorrow
- [ ] PM research report completed
- [ ] Strategic decision made (A, B, or C)
- [ ] Updated strategy document created
- [ ] Development path clear
- [ ] Next provider started (or zkWalletConnect)

## üö® Important Files to Read
1. `strategy/CONTEXT-FOR-STRATEGY.md` - Full context
2. `HOW-IT-WORKS.md` - Framework guide
3. `.goose/RULES.md` - Agent rules
4. `workspace/current/sprint.md` - Current goals
