   - Provider adapters for Railgun and Aztec

2. **Provider Adapters** (`src/adapters/`)
   - `railgun-adapter.ts` - Railgun provider integration
   - `aztec-adapter.ts` - Aztec provider integration

3. **Tests** (`src/__tests__/wallet-connect.test.ts`)
   - Basic test suite for wallet-connect functionality

4. **Examples** (`examples/auto-provider-example.ts`)
   - Usage example demonstrating auto-provider functionality

5. **Documentation** (`README.md`)
   - Package documentation with usage instructions

## Session Notes
- Agent hit maximum action limit before completing documentation
- Hand-off files were not auto-generated due to turn limit
- Code was successfully created and built
- Test suite exists but coverage is below target

## Next Actions
1. **PRIORITY:** Run test-writer agent to improve coverage from 41% to 90% target
2. Run example-writer agent to create comprehensive usage examples
3. Run doc-site-writer agent to update marketing documentation
4. Review and validate the wallet-connect implementation
5. Update sprint.md with completed tasks
