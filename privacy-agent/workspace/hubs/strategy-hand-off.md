# DeFi Integration Patterns for zkSDK

## Overview

This document outlines the key DeFi integration patterns supported by zkSDK, enabling developers to easily add privacy features to decentralized finance applications. These patterns cover the most common use cases in DeFi while maintaining strong privacy guarantees and optimal user experience.

## 1. Shielded DEX Swaps

### Pattern Description
Enable private token swaps across multiple DEX protocols while maintaining liquidity and minimizing slippage.

### go-to-market.md
# Go-to-Market Strategy for zkSDK

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive go-to-market strategy for zkSDK, designed to achieve rapid developer adoption and establish zkSDK as the "LangChain of Privacy" protocols. The strategy focuses on phased launches, targeted developer acquisition, community building, and measurable success metrics.

## Launch Strategy

### Phase 1: Developer Preview (Weeks 1-2)


### market-analysis.md
# Market Analysis for zkSDK

## Executive Summary

The privacy protocol market is experiencing significant growth as users increasingly demand financial privacy in DeFi applications. With total value locked (TVL) in privacy protocols reaching hundreds of millions of dollars and growing, there is a clear market need for unified privacy solutions. However, the current landscape is fragmented with each protocol offering different APIs, integration patterns, and user experiences.

zkSDK aims to become the "LangChain of Privacy" by providing a unified interface for developers to integrate multiple privacy protocols seamlessly. This market analysis examines the competitive landscape, market size, growth projections, and key opportunities for zkSDK.

## Market Size and Growth


### metrics-dashboard.md
# Metrics Dashboard for zkSDK

## Overview

This document defines the comprehensive metrics dashboard for tracking the success and performance of zkSDK. The dashboard is organized into key categories that align with business objectives, developer experience, product performance, and market impact. Each metric includes definitions, targets, data sources, and visualization recommendations.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### 1. Developer Adoption Metrics


### product-requirements-v1.md
# Product Requirements for zkSDK v1.0

## Overview

This document outlines the prioritized product requirements for zkSDK, organized by development phases. The goal is to deliver a minimum viable product (MVP) within 2 weeks, followed by a complete v1.0 release within 6 weeks, and a feature-rich v2.0 within 3 months.

## MVP Requirements (2 Weeks)

### Core Protocol Integration
- [x] **Railgun Integration**

### technical-architecture.md
# Technical Architecture for zkSDK

## Overview

zkSDK is designed to be the "LangChain of Privacy" - a unified SDK that provides a consistent interface for interacting with multiple privacy protocols across different blockchains. The architecture is built around abstraction layers that hide protocol-specific complexity while exposing a simple, consistent API for developers.

## Core Architecture Principles

1. **Protocol Agnostic**: Unified interface works across all supported privacy protocols
2. **Modular Design**: Pluggable architecture for adding new protocols

### unified-interface-spec.md
# Unified Interface Specification for zkSDK

## Overview

This document defines the TypeScript interfaces and API specifications for zkSDK, the "LangChain of Privacy" protocols. The unified interface provides a consistent, protocol-agnostic API for interacting with multiple privacy protocols across different blockchains.

## Core SDK Interface

```typescript
interface ZkSDK {
