# Legacy Automation Scripts

Historical helpers kept for reference. The active workflow now lives in the top-level scripts:

- `prepare-context.sh`
- `daily-run-strategy.sh`
- `daily-run-dev.sh`
- `run-pm-research.sh`
- `run-product-manager.sh`
- `run-developer.sh`
- `run-example-writer.sh`
- `run-test-writer.sh`
- `generate-daily-report.sh`
- `start-new-session.sh`

Scripts in this folder expect the pre-Framework-V2 layout and may reference deprecated paths (`recipes/`, `memory/`, `outputs/`, etc.). Keep them for archeology, but prefer the new pipeline when running agents.
