1. **Tornado Cash SDK**
   - Limited to Ethereum mixing functionality
   - Simple but narrow scope
   - No cross-protocol capabilities

2. **Aztec SDK**
   - Focused on Aztec Connect and Noir contracts
   - Good developer experience but protocol-specific
   - Limited to Aztec ecosystem

3. **Railgun SDK**
   - EVM-specific privacy solution
   - Good integration with Ethereum contracts
   - Limited to Railgun ecosystem

#### Multi-Protocol Solutions
1. **Privacy Pools (Conceptual)**
   - Early-stage research projects
   - Not production-ready
   - Limited developer adoption

2. **Web3 Libraries with Privacy Extensions**
   - ethers.js, viem, web3.js with privacy plugins
   - Fragmented ecosystem
   - Inconsistent APIs across protocols

### Indirect Competitors

#### Layer 2 Privacy Solutions
- Aztec Network
- Penumbra
- These provide privacy but at protocol level, not SDK level

#### FHE Solutions
- Zama fhEVM
- Espresso Systems
- Focus on fully homomorphic encryption rather than unified privacy
