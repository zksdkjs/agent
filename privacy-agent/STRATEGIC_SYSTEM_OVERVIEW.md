# 🚀 STRATEGIC GOOSE AGENT SYSTEM

## Overview
This system enables Goose agents to work continuously with proper session management, memory persistence, and progress tracking.

## Key Components

### 1. Session Manager (`session-manager.sh`)
- Finds and resumes existing sessions automatically
- Handles session persistence via Goose's built-in session support
- Prevents agents from starting over each time

### 2. Memory System (`memory/`)
- `build_progress.json` - Tracks actual implementation status
- `current_session.md` - Active session context
- `CURRENT_WORK.md` - Overall project status

### 3. Smart Launchers

#### `launch-strategic-system.sh`
- Main orchestrator with intelligent provider selection
- Updates build progress before and after each run
- Creates proper session context for agents
- Supports both auto-mode and specific provider mode

#### `smart-continue-real-hour.sh`
- Runs for exactly 1 hour with automatic restarts
- Focuses on incomplete work first
- Shows real-time progress tracking

#### `run-forever.sh`
- Continuous operation with pause/resume support
- Saves state between runs
- Prevents multiple instances
- Shows progress after each cycle

### 4. Improved Recipes (`recipes/`)
- `recipe-continue-work.yaml` - Generic continuation recipe
- Memory-aware instructions that prevent starting over
- Focus on specific tasks, not exploration

## How It Works

1. **Progress Tracking**: The system counts actual TypeScript lines in each provider directory
2. **Priority Selection**: Works on partial implementations first, then not started, then improvements
3. **Session Persistence**: Uses Goose's `--resume` flag to continue from previous sessions
4. **Memory Context**: Each session reads memory files to understand current state
5. **Automatic Restarts**: If an agent stops, the system restarts it with the same context

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Run continuously until all providers are complete
./run-forever.sh

# Work on specific provider for 1 hour
./smart-continue-real-hour.sh

# Run one cycle on next priority
./launch-strategic-system.sh

# Work on specific provider
./launch-strategic-system.sh railgun
```

### Pause and Resume
1. Press Ctrl+C to pause any running script
2. Run the same script again to resume from where you left off
3. Sessions are automatically saved and restored

### Monitor Progress
```bash
# Check real status
./check-real-status.sh

# View build progress
cat memory/build_progress.json | jq

# Check session logs
ls -la logs/
```

## Best Practices

1. **Let It Run**: The system is designed to run continuously. Don't interrupt unless needed.

2. **Trust the Memory**: Agents will read memory files and continue appropriately.

3. **High Turn Counts**: We use 300-500 turns to ensure tasks complete.

4. **One Provider at a Time**: System focuses on one provider until it's substantially complete.

5. **Automatic Recovery**: If an agent fails, the system restarts it automatically.

## Troubleshooting

### Agents Starting Over
- Check that memory files exist and are updated
- Ensure recipes include memory-reading instructions
- Verify session persistence is working

### No Progress Being Made
- Check logs in `logs/` directory
- Verify provider directories exist
- Ensure proper file permissions

### Multiple Instances
- Check for lock file: `/tmp/goose-continuous.lock`
- Kill any stuck processes: `pkill -f goose`

## Expected Results

With this system, you should see:
- Agents continuing from previous work
- Steady progress on each provider
- Automatic completion of all providers
- No redundant work or starting over
