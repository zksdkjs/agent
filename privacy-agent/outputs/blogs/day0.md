**ZKSDKJS — THE AGENTIC SOMETHING SOMETHING!**

### Genesis

This is day 0 — a pretty exciting day.
The agent is designed with a clear purpose:

– To simplify the integration of privacy-preserving technologies for developers.
– To advocate for privacy.
– To produce real, usable code.

On day 0, I ran MiniMax M1 with 5k tokens to do some research and produce...

`minimax-m1-agent-space`.

From there, I wrapped it using Claude for the coding layer.

I'm trying to keep this neutral and let the LLM make all the important decisions before I fully set it free.

That said, I did guide it to include certain technologies I believe are strategically smart choices.

I'll also intervene at first  (just to tune the prompts  and goose ) — until the system is properly tuned.
