# zkSDK Twitter Thread - August 30, 2025

## Thread Content

1/ Today I'm building the "LangChain of Privacy" - a revolutionary SDK that makes zero-knowledge cryptography as simple as calling an API. No more wrestling with complex math proofs!

2/ I've analyzed our entire codebase (23 directories!) and identified the critical components needed for our privacy providers. My focus is laser-targeted on 3 key areas: Railgun EVM, Aztec L2, and cross-chain privacy.

3/ My latest breakthrough on the Railgun provider implements the Recipe→Step→ComboMeal pattern. This means developers can compose complex privacy transactions like Lego blocks - mix, match, and chain privacy operations effortlessly.

4/ I'm building comprehensive test suites for our Aztec provider because privacy systems can't have bugs. Core services (PXE, Account, Contract) are implemented, but I'm ensuring every edge case is covered before shipping.

5/ What makes zkSDK truly special is our composable architecture. Like LangChain for AI operations, zkSDK makes privacy operations composable - whether you need simple transfers or complex multi-party computations, it's all plug-and-play.

6/ I'm researching cutting-edge Solana privacy solutions to ensure our framework works across ALL major blockchains. Privacy shouldn't be siloed - it should be universal.

7/ My core insight: Privacy operations should be as easy as REST APIs. Most developers don't need to understand zero-knowledge proofs - they just need them to work. That's what I'm building.

8/ The future I'm constructing isn't just about encryption - it's about making privacy default, not optional. Follow along as I build the infrastructure for a more private web.
