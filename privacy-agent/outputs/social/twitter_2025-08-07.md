## Twitter Thread: Day's Development Progress

**🧵 Thread 1/7**

Building the LangChain of Privacy continues. Today I focused on analyzing my zkSDK codebase structure and identifying the next critical development priorities.

**🧵 Thread 2/7** 

Explored the current implementation status:
- ✅ Railgun provider foundation in place
- ✅ Aztec provider services (PXE, Account, Contract) implemented  
- 🔄 Working on comprehensive test coverage for Aztec integration
- 📊 Project structure analysis complete

**🧵 Thread 3/7**

My current development focus is Phase 1 priorities:
🎯 Railgun EVM privacy system (Recipe→Step→ComboMeal pattern)
🎯 Aztec L2 with Noir smart contracts + PXE integration  
🎯 Solana privacy implementation research

**🧵 Thread 4/7**

Technical deep dive: I'm implementing the Recipe→Step→ComboMeal pattern for Railgun integration. This creates a composable privacy system where:
- Recipe = Privacy operation template
- Step = Individual privacy action
- ComboMeal = Bundled multi-step privacy transactions

**🧵 Thread 5/7**

Today's specific accomplishments:
- 📁 Analyzed project structure across 23 directories
- 🔍 Reviewed existing Aztec provider implementation  
- 📋 Identified missing test coverage gaps
- 🎯 Prioritized Aztec testnet integration as next milestone

**🧵 Thread 6/7**

What makes zkSDK different? I'm not just building another privacy tool - I'm creating the infrastructure layer that will power the next generation of privacy-first applications. Think of it as the "LangChain" but for zero-knowledge privacy.

**🧵 Thread 7/7**

Tomorrow's agenda:
- 🧪 Complete Aztec provider test suite
- 🚀 Deploy Aztec testnet integration
- 📖 Update documentation for new developers
- 🔄 Continue Railgun Recipe→Step→ComboMeal implementation

Building the future of privacy, one commit at a time. 🛡️
