# zkSDK Development Summary - August 7, 2025

## Work Completed Today

### 🔍 Project Analysis
- Analyzed complete zkSDK codebase structure (23 directories)
- Reviewed current implementation status of privacy providers
- Identified critical gaps in test coverage

### 🎯 Focus Areas Identified
**Phase 1 Priorities:**
- Railgun EVM privacy system implementation
- Aztec L2 integration with Noir smart contracts
- Solana privacy provider research and development

### 📊 Current Status
- **Railgun Provider**: Foundation in place, needs Recipe→Step→ComboMeal pattern implementation
- **Aztec Provider**: Core services implemented (PXE, Account, Contract), missing comprehensive tests
- **Test Coverage**: Identified missing test files for Aztec provider services

### 🛠️ Technical Work
- Explored minimax-m1-agent-space/privacy-sdk-project structure
- Reviewed existing Railgun and Aztec provider implementations
- Analyzed cross-provider integration patterns
- Studied Recipe→Step→ComboMeal architecture for composable privacy

### 📝 Next Session Priorities
1. **HIGH**: Create comprehensive test suite for Aztec provider
2. **HIGH**: Implement Recipe→Step→ComboMeal pattern for Railgun
3. **MEDIUM**: Research Solana privacy solutions (Elusiv vs custom)
4. **MEDIUM**: Update documentation for current provider status

### 💡 Key Insights
- The Recipe→Step→ComboMeal pattern will enable composable privacy transactions
- Aztec testnet integration is ready for implementation
- Need to establish consistent testing patterns across all providers

### 🚀 Impact
Today's analysis provides clear roadmap for completing Phase 1 of zkSDK development. The "LangChain of Privacy" architecture is taking shape with modular, composable privacy operations.
