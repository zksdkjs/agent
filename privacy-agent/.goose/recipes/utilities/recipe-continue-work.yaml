description: "Continue from existing work - don't start over"

instructions: |
  YOU ARE CONTINUING EXISTING WORK. DO NOT START OVER.
  
  CRITICAL: First read memory/CURRENT_WORK.md to understand what's done.
  
  COMPLETED (DO NOT REDO):
  - FHEVM provider if > 900 lines
  - Any provider with > 500 lines of code
  
  YOUR FOCUS:
  1. Check memory/current_session.md for your specific task
  2. Count actual lines: find sdk/packages/providers -name "*.ts" -exec wc -l {} \;
  3. Continue implementation from where it stopped
  4. Build on existing code, don't replace it
  
  DO NOT WASTE TIME ON:
  - pwd, ls -la, reading README
  - Checking basic project structure
  - Starting implementations from scratch
  - Working on completed providers
  
  REQUIRED OUTPUT:
  - Actual code in provider files
  - Tests for your implementation
  - Update index.ts exports

prompt: |
  Continue implementing the SDK providers. Read memory files first to understand current status.
  Focus on incomplete work and build upon existing code.
