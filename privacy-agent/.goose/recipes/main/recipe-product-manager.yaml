  - Building: DEX aggregators, lending protocols, yield optimizers
  - Needs: Composability, gas efficiency, MEV protection
  - Pain points: Each protocol different, no unified liquidity
  - Success metrics: Integration time < 1 week, gas < $50/tx

  ### Persona 2: dApp Frontend Developer
  - Building: Privacy-preserving social, gaming, NFT platforms
  - Needs: Simple React hooks, wallet abstraction, UX polish
  - Pain points: Complex wallet setup, slow proofs, poor errors
  - Success metrics: < 100 lines integration code, < 10s proof time

  ### Persona 3: Institutional Developer
  - Building: Compliant private trading, custody solutions
  - Needs: Selective disclosure, audit trails, multi-sig
  - Pain points: Regulatory uncertainty, no standards
  - Success metrics: Compliance ready, hardware wallet support

  ### Persona 4: Bitcoin Ecosystem Developer
  - Building: Bitcoin L2s, Lightning apps, DLCs
  - Needs: Silent payments, atomic swaps, PSBT support
  - Pain points: Limited scripting, fragmented ecosystem
  - Success metrics: Full Bitcoin privacy suite integrated

  ## PHASE 3: TECHNICAL PRODUCT STRATEGY

  ### Create: `/strategy/product/technical-architecture.md`

  **Core Abstraction Layers:**
  1. Proof System Abstraction
     - Support Groth16, PLONK, STARK, Bulletproofs, FHE
     - Automatic proof system selection
     - Proof generation optimization

  2. Account Model Abstraction
     - UTXO (Bitcoin, Monero-like)
     - Account (Ethereum, Solana)
     - Shielded pools (shared liquidity)

  3. Transaction Construction Pipeline
     - Input validation
     - Witness generation
     - Proof computation (WASM/Worker)
     - Transaction assembly
     - Relayer/broadcast

  ### Create: `/strategy/product/unified-interface-spec.md`

  ```typescript
  interface UnifiedPrivacySDK {
    // Core operations (all protocols)
    transfer(to: string, amount: BigNumber): Promise<TxHash>
    getBalance(token?: Address): Promise<BigNumber>
    deposit(amount: BigNumber): Promise<TxHash>
    withdraw(amount: BigNumber): Promise<TxHash>

    // DeFi operations (most protocols)
    swap(params: SwapParams): Promise<TxHash>
    addLiquidity(params: LiquidityParams): Promise<TxHash>
    stake(params: StakeParams): Promise<TxHash>

    // Advanced (protocol-specific)
    provider.railgun?.adaptContract(...)
    provider.aztec?.deployNoir(...)
    provider.bitcoin?.createSilentAddress(...)
    provider.fhevm?.encryptedCompute(...)
  }
