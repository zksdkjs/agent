# zkSDK x402 Integration: Micropayments for Privacy Services

We're excited to announce the integration of Coinbase's **x402 payments protocol** into zkSDK, bringing seamless micropayment capabilities to privacy-preserving applications and AI agents.

## What is x402?

[x402](https://github.com/coinbase/x402) is an open, internet-native micropayments protocol developed by Coinbase that enables one-line integrations for accepting digital dollars. With features like:

- **Sub-cent precision**: Payments as low as $0.001
- **Zero fees**: No platform fees for resource servers
- **Fast settlement**: 2-second blockchain confirmations
- **Multi-chain support**: Works across EVM, Solana, and soon Sui
- **HTTP native**: Built on the standard HTTP 402 Payment Required status code

```typescript
// One line to protect your API with payments
app.use(paymentMiddleware('0xYourAddress', { '/api/*': '$0.001' }));
```

## Why Integrate x402 with zkSDK?

The integration brings compelling value to the zkSDK ecosystem:

### For Privacy Service Developers
- **Monetize privacy features** without complex payment infrastructure
- **Standardized integration patterns** that work across all zkSDK providers
- **Reduced friction** for users to pay for privacy services
- **Cross-chain payment compatibility** matching zkSDK's multi-chain vision

### For End Users
- **Micro-payments** for privacy features without large upfront costs
- **Transparent pricing** with clear payment requirements
- **Fast settlement times** with 2-second blockchain confirmations
- **Familiar payment UX** that works with existing wallets

### For AI Agents
- **Autonomous resource payment** capabilities for privacy services
- **Seamless integration** with zkSDK's privacy workflows
- **Programmable spending controls** and budget management
- **Audit trail** for compliance and expense tracking

## Integration Highlights

### Unified Payment API
zkSDK now provides a consistent interface for x402 payments across all supported chains:

```typescript
// Create payments using the unified zkSDK interface
await zkSDK.transfer({
  chain: 'base',
  token: 'USDC',
  amount: '1000', // 0.001 USDC
  to: '0x...',
  privacy: 'shielded',
  payment: {
    scheme: 'exact',
    resource: 'https://api.example.com/service'
  }
});
```

### Privacy-Enhanced Payments
Leverage zkSDK's privacy capabilities for enhanced payment privacy:

- **FHE-encrypted payment amounts** using Zama's FHEVM
- **Shielded payment workflows** with Aztec and Railgun
- **Confidential pricing discovery** for privacy-preserving services
- **Zero-knowledge payment verification** for maximum privacy

### AI Agent Integration
Enable autonomous payment capabilities for AI agents:

```typescript
// AI agents can now make autonomous payment decisions
const agent = new PaymentCapableAgent(1.00); // $1.00 budget
const result = await agent.makePaymentRequest('https://api.privacy-service.com/data');
```

## Technical Architecture

The integration follows zkSDK's modular provider pattern:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              APPLICATION LAYER                 │
│  (Frontend, Backend, AI Agents)                 │
└─────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                      │
              ┌───────▼────────┐
              │   @zksdk/core  │
              │   ZkSDK Class  │
              └───────┬────────┘
                      │
        ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
        │             │             │
┌───────▼────────┐ ┌──▼─────────┐ ┌─▼──────────────┐
│ @zksdk/providers │ │ @zksdk/    │ │ @zksdk/        │
│     /x402      │ │ middleware │ │ providers/*    │
│                │ │            │ │ (privacy)      │
└────────────────┘ └────────────┘ └────────────────┘
```

### Supported Chains
- **EVM Chains**: Ethereum, Base, Polygon, Arbitrum via EIP-3009
- **SVM Chains**: Solana via partially signed transactions
- **Planned**: Sui integration (following x402 protocol development)

## Getting Started

### Installation
```bash
npm install @zksdk/core @zksdk/providers/x402
```

### Basic Setup
```typescript
import { ZkSDK } from '@zksdk/core';
import { X402Provider } from '@zksdk/providers/x402';

const sdk = new ZkSDK({
  providers: {
    x402: new X402Provider()
  }
});

await sdk.getProvider('x402').initialize({
  facilitatorUrl: 'https://facilitator.x402.org',
  defaultNetwork: 'base'
});
```

### Protecting Your API
```typescript
import express from 'express';
import { paymentMiddleware } from '@zksdk/middleware';

const app = express();

app.use(paymentMiddleware(
  '0xYourWalletAddress',
  {
    '/api/premium': {
      price: '$0.001',
      network: 'base',
      config: {
        description: 'Premium API access',
        mimeType: 'application/json'
      }
    }
  }
));

app.get('/api/premium', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ data: 'Protected premium content' });
});
```
