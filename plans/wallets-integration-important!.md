• Got it—you’re saying the SDK must never abstract away the signing semantics:

  - When a provider (e.g., Railgun) requires its own shielded wallet, we have to route the transaction through
    that wallet’s signing flow.
  - When the flow is standard Ethereum (or Solana, etc.), we must fall back to the native wallet/signing
    experience users already expect.
  - In other words: whatever wallet/signature UX the chain or privacy stack would normally demand, the SDK must
    enforce the same thing instead of applying one-size-fits-all signing.

  Here’s how I’ll tackle it:

  1. Define a lightweight WalletAdapter interface in @zksdk/core that exposes capabilities like getAddress,
     signMessage, signTransaction, and supportsChain(chainId).
  2. Produce specific adapters:
      - RailgunWalletAdapter wrapping the Railgun engine’s wallet (shield/unshield aware).
      - EvmWalletAdapter that proxies to a standard ethers.js signer for Ethereum-compatible flows.
      - Additional adapters for Solana/light-protocol, Aztec PXE accounts, etc.
  3. Update each provider so initialize() either receives an explicit adapter or derives the correct one from
     config. When a transaction is prepared, the provider asserts that the adapter matches what the underlying
     protocol requires.
  4. Add tests that exercise mismatched cases (e.g., trying to use a plain EVM signer with Railgun operations
     should throw a descriptive error) and make sure existing tests keep passing.
  5. Document it—explain how integrators plug in the right wallet adapter per provider so they don’t
     accidentally sign with the wrong tool.

  If that direction sounds right, I’ll start by shaping the core adapte
