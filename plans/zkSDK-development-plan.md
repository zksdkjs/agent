# zkSDK Development Plan - Goose Framework

## Project Overview

**Goal:** Build the "LangChain of Privacy" - A universal SDK enabling developers to make private token transfers across all blockchain ecosystems with a simple, unified API.

**NPM Organization:** @zksdkjs  
**Target API:** `zkSDK.transfer({chain, token, amount, to, privacy})`

## Strategic Phases

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Production-Ready Privacy)
**Priority:** Immediate implementation
**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks
**Models:** Qwen Coder (implementation), Claude Sonnet (code review)

1. **Railgun Provider** (Weeks 1-2)
   - Production-ready EVM privacy system
   - Recipe→Step→ComboMeal pattern integration
   - Support: Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum

2. **Aztec Provider** (Weeks 2-3) 
   - Privacy-first L2 with Noir contracts
   - PXE integration for proof execution
   - Testnet integration ready

3. **Solana Privacy Provider** (Weeks 3-4)
   - Research best Solana privacy solution
   - Native SOL + SPL token private transfers
   - Integration with Solana ecosystem

### Phase 2: Extended Integration (High-Value Privacy)
**Priority:** After Phase 1 completion
**Timeline:** 6-8 weeks
**Models:** GPT-4 (planning), Claude Sonnet (implementation)

4. **Midnight Provider** (Weeks 5-6)
   - Cardano privacy sidechain integration
   - Compact DSL smart contract support
   - NIGHT/DUST dual-token model
   - Local proof server integration

5. **Mina Provider** (Weeks 6-7)
   - zkApps with o1js TypeScript integration
   - Lightweight blockchain privacy

6. **Zama FHE Provider** (Weeks 7-8)
   - Homomorphic encryption for confidential computing
   - EVM-compatible private computation

## Implementation Strategy

### Multi-Model Orchestration
- **Strategic Planning:** GPT-4 (complex reasoning, architecture decisions)
- **Code Implementation:** Qwen Coder (efficient, fast development)
- **Code Review:** Claude Sonnet (quality, security, best practices)
- **Documentation:** Claude Sonnet (clear, comprehensive docs)

### Iterative Planning Process

**Step 1: Clarification Phase**
Each provider implementation begins with agents asking:
- What are the specific integration requirements?
- Which test networks should we target first?
- What are the expected gas costs and proof times?
- How should error handling work for this provider?
- What authentication/setup is required?

**Step 2: Sub-Plan Creation**
Based on clarifications, create detailed sub-plans for:
- Provider architecture and interfaces
- Authentication and configuration
- Core transfer implementation
- Error handling and validation
- Testing strategy and coverage
- Documentation and examples

**Step 3: Implementation Execution**
Agents execute sub-plans with continuous refinement:
- Code implementation with real-time testing
- Integration testing with mock transactions
- Performance benchmarking
- Security validation
- Documentation updates

**Step 4: Integration Validation**
- Cross-provider compatibility testing
- Universal API validation
- Performance comparison across providers
- Security audit preparation

## Agent Communication Patterns

### Primary Agents
1. **Strategic Planner** (GPT-4) - Architecture decisions, priority management
2. **Lead Developer** (Qwen Coder) - Core implementation, rapid prototyping  
3. **Quality Assurance** (Claude Sonnet) - Code review, testing, security
4. **Documentation Lead** (Claude Sonnet) - API docs, integration guides

### Communication Flow
- **Daily Standups:** Progress reports and blocker identification
- **Architecture Reviews:** Major design decision validation
- **Code Reviews:** All implementation changes reviewed before merge
- **Integration Planning:** Cross-provider compatibility discussions

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] Universal API supports ETH, L2, SOL private transfers
- [ ] All providers pass integration tests
- [ ] Gas costs documented and optimized
- [ ] Proof times under 30 seconds average
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage across all providers
- [ ] Security review completed

### Phase 2 Success Criteria  
- [ ] Midnight integration with Compact DSL support
- [ ] Mina zkApps integration functional
- [ ] Zama FHE basic operations working
- [ ] Cross-chain compatibility validated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks documented
- [ ] Production deployment ready

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Provider Complexity:** Some systems (Aztec, Midnight) still in development
- **Integration Challenges:** Different privacy models may not align perfectly
- **Performance Issues:** Proof generation times could impact UX

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with most mature providers (Railgun first)
- Create fallback options for each chain
- Implement timeout and retry logic
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## Quality Gates

### Before Moving to Next Phase
1. All current phase providers must be fully functional
2. Integration tests passing with >95% success rate  
3. Documentation complete and validated
4. Performance benchmarks meet targets
5. Security review findings addressed

### Continuous Quality Checks
- Code coverage maintained above 90%
- Integration tests run on every commit
- Performance regression testing
- Security scanning and vulnerability assessment

## Next Steps

1. **Create Sub-Plans:** Detailed implementation plans for each provider
2. **Set Up Multi-Model Configuration:** Configure Goose with appropriate models
3. **Initialize Development Environment:** Set up testing, CI/CD, documentation
4. **Begin Railgun Implementation:** Start with most mature provider first
