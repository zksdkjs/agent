# zkSDK x402 Integration Plan

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Integrate Coinbase's x402 micropayments protocol into zkSDK to enable seamless, privacy-preserving monetization of AI agent services and decentralized applications.

**Target API**: 
```typescript
// New x402 provider in zkSDK
await zkSDK.transfer({
  chain: 'base',
  token: 'USDC',
  amount: '1000', // 0.001 USDC
  to: '0x...',
  privacy: 'shielded',
  payment: {
    scheme: 'exact',
    resource: 'https://api.example.com/service'
  }
});

// x402 middleware for zkSDK services
app.use(paymentMiddleware(
  payToAddress,
  {
    '/api/analyze': {
      price: '$0.001',
      network: 'base',
      description: 'AI analysis service'
    }
  }
));
```

    // Configure facilitator connection
    // Setup signer/wallet integration
  }
  
  async createPayment(params: PaymentParams): Promise<PaymentResult> {
    // Create x402 payment authorization

- **Wallet Integration**: Supporting diverse wallet types and signing methods
- **Facilitator Dependence**: Managing trust and reliability of payment verification
- **Performance**: Ensuring fast payment processing without impacting service UX

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with EVM implementation (most mature ecosystem)
- Create comprehensive fallback mechanisms
- Implement timeout and retry logic
- Develop self-hosted facilitator options

### Security Risks
- **Payment Replay**: Ensuring nonce-based protection
- **Signature Verification**: Proper cryptographic validation
- **Amount Manipulation**: Preventing payment amount tampering
- **Privacy Leaks**: Ensuring payment data doesn't compromise service privacy

### Security Mitigation
- Implement strict cryptographic verification
- Add comprehensive input validation
- Integrate with zkSDK's existing security framework
- Conduct regular security audits
