# x402 Payments Protocol Research Report

## Executive Summary

x402 is an open, internet-native micropayments protocol developed by Coinbase that enables seamless, low-friction payments for digital resources over HTTP. Built on the HTTP 402 Payment Required status code, x402 offers a standardized approach to monetizing web services with sub-cent precision, zero fees for resource servers, and 2-second settlement times.

This report analyzes the technical architecture, implementation patterns, and integration opportunities for x402 within zkSDK to enable privacy-preserving monetization of AI agents and decentralized services.

## Technical Overview

### Core Architecture

x402 follows a three-component architecture:
1. **Resource Server**: Provides protected resources and specifies payment requirements
2. **Client**: Requests resources and makes payments
3. **Facilitator Server**: Verifies payments and settles transactions on-chain

### Protocol Flow

1. Client makes HTTP request to resource server
2. Resource server responds with 402 Payment Required + payment requirements
3. Client creates and signs payment authorization
4. Client resends request with X-PAYMENT header
5. Resource server verifies payment via facilitator
6. Facilitator settles payment on-chain
7. Resource server grants access to resource

### Supported Schemes and Networks

x402 currently supports the "exact" payment scheme on:
- EVM chains (Ethereum, Base, Polygon, Arbitrum) via EIP-3009
- SVM chains (Solana) via partially signed transactions
- Future support planned for Sui

### Key Features

- **Micropayments**: Supports payments as low as $0.001
- **Zero Fees**: No platform fees for resource servers
- **Fast Settlement**: 2-second blockchain confirmations
- **Chain Agnostic**: Works across multiple blockchain networks
- **HTTP Native**: Seamlessly integrates with existing web infrastructure

## Integration Opportunities with zkSDK

### 1. Privacy-Preserving Payments
x402 can enable privacy-preserving monetization of zkSDK services, allowing:
- Private payment for private transactions
- Shielded resource access
- Confidential pricing models

### 2. AI Agent Monetization
AI agents using zkSDK can:
- Pay for privacy services automatically
- Monetize their own outputs with x402
- Create autonomous payment workflows

### 3. Cross-Chain Payment Support
x402's multi-chain architecture aligns with zkSDK's cross-chain vision:
- Unified payment interface across privacy protocols
- Seamless chain switching for cost optimization
- Integrated settlement mechanisms

## Implementation Analysis

### EVM Integration (Exact Scheme)
- Uses EIP-3009 TransferWithAuthorization
- Client signs specific amount transfers
- Facilitator executes without holding funds
- Compatible with zkSDK's Railgun provider

### SVM Integration (Exact Scheme)
- Uses partially signed transactions
- Client signs payment portion
- Facilitator signs as fee payer
- Compatible with zkSDK's Privacy Cash provider
