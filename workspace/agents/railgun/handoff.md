**Session 1/5: Install Railgun Cookbook SDK & Implement Recipeâ†’Stepâ†’ComboMeal Pattern**

Railgun uses the official "Railgun Cookbook" SDK which has food-themed terminology:
- **Step:** Single smart contract call
- **Recipe:** Multiple steps combined into a workflow
- **ComboMeal:** Multiple recipes for complex operations

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd sdk/packages/providers/railgun
   npm install @railgun-community/cookbook
   ```

2. **Create Directory Structure:**
   ```
   src/
   â”œâ”€â”€ railgun-provider.ts    (main provider)
   â”œâ”€â”€ steps/                 (individual contract calls)
   â”œâ”€â”€ recipes/               (workflow combinations)
   â””â”€â”€ combomeals/            (complex multi-recipe operations)
   ```

3. **Implement Core Provider:**
   - Initialize Railgun network
   - Wallet connection
   - Private balance management
   - Transaction broadcasting

4. **Success Criteria:**
   - [ ] Railgun Cookbook SDK installed
   - [ ] Directory structure created
   - [ ] Core provider initialized
   - [ ] Build passes: `cd sdk && npm run build`
   - [ ] Basic tests passing

**Reference:** See main handoff at `workspace/hubs/dev-hand-off.md` and check Railgun Cookbook documentation.
