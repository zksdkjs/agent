FHEVM implementation is already complete (927 lines) - this agent focuses on verification and final polish:

**Verification Steps:**

1. **Review Existing Implementation:**
   - Check `sdk/packages/providers/fhevm/src/` for completeness
   - Verify all fhEVM operations are implemented
   - Review encrypted computation logic
   - Validate gateway integration

2. **Add Missing Tests:**
   - Encrypted arithmetic operations
   - Contract interaction tests
   - Gateway decryption tests
   - Error handling tests

3. **Documentation Review:**
   - JSDoc completeness
   - Usage examples
   - Integration guides
   - API reference

4. **Success Criteria:**
   - [ ] All FHEVM functionality verified
   - [ ] Test coverage > 90%
   - [ ] Build passes: `cd sdk && npm run build`
   - [ ] All tests passing: `cd sdk && npm test`
   - [ ] Documentation complete

**Important:** DO NOT rewrite or refactor existing code. This provider is marked as COMPLETE. Only add tests and documentation.
