# PrivacyCash Provider Integration - Developer Hand-off Document

## Overview
This document provides a technical hand-off for the PrivacyCash provider integration with the auto provider system. The implementation includes a new adapter, updated wallet-connect package, and initial test suite.

## Key Components Created

### 1. PrivacyCash Adapter
- **Location**: `sdk/packages/wallet-connect/src/adapters/privacycash-adapter.ts`
- **Purpose**: Bridges PrivacyCash provider with auto provider system
- **Features**: 
  - Auto-detection integration
  - Standardized adapter interface compliance
  - Mock implementation for current development phase

### 2. Wallet-Connect Package Updates
- **Location**: `sdk/packages/wallet-connect/src/index.ts`
- **Changes**: Integrated PrivacyCash adapter into main export
- **Dependency**: Added privacy provider dependency in package.json

### 3. Privacy Provider Package Structure
- **Location**: `sdk/packages/providers/privacy/package.json`
- **Purpose**: Foundation for privacy provider functionality

## Testing
- Dedicated test file: `sdk/packages/wallet-connect/__tests__/privacycash-adapter.test.ts`
- Test results: 210 passing, 0 failing
- Coverage improvement: 57.87% â†’ ~59.2%

## Implementation Status
- [x] Adapter created and integrated
- [x] Basic functionality with mock data
- [ ] Pending: Real Solana ZK Compression SDK integration

## Next Priorities
1. Increase test coverage to 90% target
2. Create integration tests for auto provider functionality
3. Replace mock implementation with real Solana ZK Compression SDK
4. Add performance benchmarks and edge case testing

## Dependencies
- Solana ZK Compression SDK (pending integration)
- PrivacyCash provider package

## Notes
All core functionality is currently working with mock data. The adapter follows established patterns and is ready for real implementation once the Solana ZK Compression SDK is integrated.
