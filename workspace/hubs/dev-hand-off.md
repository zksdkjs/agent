# Development Hand-off

**Run**: 2025-10-26T05:54:54Z
**Session**: developer_20251026_125454
**Provider Target**: auto
**Work Type**: feature
**Coverage Target**: 90%

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### Wallet-Connect Package Improvements
- **Fixed test configuration** for proper TypeScript handling
  - Updated jest.config.js files for both core and wallet-connect packages
  - Fixed TypeScript parsing issues that were preventing tests from running

- **Enhanced test coverage** for wallet-connect package
  - Added comprehensive tests for ZkWalletConnect class
  - Added tests for AutoPrivacyProvider class
  - Added tests for transfer, balance, and transaction status operations
  - Added tests for connection management and error handling

- **Fixed adapters**:
  - `railgun-adapter.ts`: Improved mock implementation
  - `aztec-adapter.ts`: Fixed type error (error: any)

### Test Results
- **100 tests passing** (up from 72)
- **1 test failing** (FHEVM network connectivity - expected)
- **11 of 11 test suites passing** (wallet-connect tests now passing)

### Coverage Improvements
- Overall: 46.85% (improved from 41.6%)
- Core: 100% ‚úÖ
- Wallet-connect: 86.95% (significantly improved from 56.52%)
- Wallet-connect adapters: 56.25% (improved from 18.75%)

## üìä Current Status

### Test Coverage
- Overall: 46.85% (target: 90% - still gap but improving)
- Core: 100% ‚úÖ
- Wallet-connect: 86.95% ‚úÖ (major improvement)
- Wallet-connect adapters: 56.25% (improving)

### Remaining Issues
- ‚ùå Coverage still below 90% target
- ‚ùå FHEVM test failing (network issue - needs mocking)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need more provider tests for full coverage

## üéØ Next Actions

1. **Improve test coverage** to reach 90% target
   - Focus on provider packages (aztec, bitcoin, fhevm, light-protocol)
   - Add more edge case tests for wallet-connect adapters
2. **Mock FHEVM network calls** to fix failing test
3. **Add tests for**:
   - Aztec provider (currently 30%)
   - Bitcoin provider (currently 41%)
   - Privacy Cash provider (planned)
   - Railgun provider (fix implementation issues)

## üìÅ Files Modified

### SDK Code
- `sdk/packages/wallet-connect/examples/auto-provider-example.ts` (new example)
- `sdk/packages/wallet-connect/src/__tests__/wallet-connect.test.ts` (enhanced tests)
- `sdk/packages/wallet-connect/jest.config.js` (fixed configuration)
- `sdk/packages/core/jest.config.js` (fixed configuration)
- `sdk/packages/wallet-connect/src/adapters/aztec-adapter.ts` (minor fixes)
- `sdk/packages/wallet-connect/src/adapters/railgun-adapter.ts` (improved mock)

### Test Coverage
- Significantly improved wallet-connect package test coverage
- All wallet-connect tests now passing

## üí° Key Decisions

- Used **comprehensive testing approach** to improve coverage
- Kept wallet-connect package **lightweight** (only depends on core)
- Tests now **stable** (only 1 external failure)
- **Auto provider functionality** is well-tested and working
