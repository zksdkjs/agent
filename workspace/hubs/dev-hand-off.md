# Development Hand-Off Document - Railgun SDK Integration

## üìÖ Date: October 27, 2025
## üë®‚Äçüíª Work Completed By: Goose AI Assistant

## üéØ Overview
This document summarizes all the changes made during the Railgun SDK integration effort to fix module resolution and initialization issues between the wallet-connect package and railgun-provider.

## üîß Key Issues Addressed and Solutions Implemented

### 1. Module Resolution Problem
**Issue**: Wallet-connect package couldn't find `@zksdk/railgun-provider` module during testing
**Solution**: 
- Updated `moduleNameMapper` in wallet-connect's jest.config.js to properly map the railgun provider paths
- Configured proper workspace references to enable cross-package imports

### 2. Adapter Initialization Issues
**Issue**: Railgun adapter's initialize method was failing, causing connection failures
**Root Cause**: Railgun provider wasn't properly initializing the Railgun engine (code was commented out with TODO)
**Solution**:
- Added logging to trace the initialization failure
- Implemented proper Railgun engine initialization structure
- Added network mapping functions for all supported EVM networks

### 3. Missing Mocks
**Issue**: Missing mocks for `@railgun-community/wallet` module were causing runtime errors
**Solution**:
- Created mock file for railgun-wallet.ts
- Updated jest configurations in both root and package-level configs to include the new mock
- Added proper mock implementations for wallet functions

### 4. Database Path Validation Issue (Newly Discovered)
**Issue**: Railgun SDK has strict validation on database paths, rejecting paths with certain characters including "."
**Evidence**: Error message "Invalid character for wallet source: ." indicates the SDK's validateWalletSource function is rejecting "./railgun-db" path
**Status**: Currently investigating what path formats are acceptable to the Railgun SDK
