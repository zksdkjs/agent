# Railgun SDK Integration Debugging Session Report
## October 27, 2025

### Session Details
- **Date**: October 27, 2025
- **Time**: 12:46 PM
- **Duration**: Ongoing
- **Participants**: Development Team

### Objectives
- Debug and resolve module resolution issues between wallet-connect and railgun-provider packages
- Fix adapter initialization problems in the Railgun integration
- Address dependency resolution errors preventing test execution
- Create comprehensive documentation of changes made

### Progress Summary
- Successfully resolved module resolution issues between packages
- Improved adapter initialization with better error tracing
- Created mock infrastructure for Railgun SDK components
- Discovered new blocking issue with Railgun SDK database path validation
- Updated documentation with today's progress

## Key Issues Addressed

### 1. Module Resolution Problem ✅ RESOLVED
**Issue**: Wallet-connect package couldn't find `@zksdk/railgun-provider` module during testing
**Root Cause**: Incorrect Jest configuration in wallet-connect package
**Solution**: 
- Updated `moduleNameMapper` in wallet-connect's jest.config.js to properly map the railgun provider paths
- Verified cross-package imports now working correctly

### 2. Adapter Initialization Issues ✅ IMPROVED
**Issue**: Railgun adapter's initialize method was failing, causing connection failures during tests
**Root Cause**: Railgun provider wasn't properly initializing the Railgun engine (code was commented out with TODO)
**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive logging to trace the initialization failure points
- Improved error tracing with better logging throughout the initialization flow

### 3. Missing Mocks ✅ RESOLVED
**Issue**: Missing mocks for `@railgun-community/wallet` module were causing runtime errors
**Root Cause**: Incomplete test environment setup
**Solution**:
- Created mock file for railgun-wallet.ts with proper mock implementations
- Updated jest configurations in both root and package-level configs to include the new mock
- Added comprehensive mock implementations for wallet functions to enable test execution

### 4. Database Path Validation Issue ❌ NEW BLOCKING ISSUE
**Issue**: Railgun SDK has strict validation on database paths, rejecting paths with certain characters including "."
**Evidence**: Error message "Invalid character for wallet source: ." indicates the SDK's validateWalletSource function is rejecting "./railgun-db" path
**Status**: Currently investigating what path formats are acceptable to the Railgun SDK

## Configuration Updates Made

### 1. Wallet-Connect Jest Configuration
- Updated `moduleNameMapper` with proper mapping for `@zksdk/railgun-provider`
- Added workspace package resolution paths for proper cross-package imports

### 2. Railgun Provider Jest Configuration
- Verified module name mapping for workspace packages
- Confirmed test environment settings properly configured

### 3. Root Jest Configuration
- Updated to include railgun-wallet mock in the setup
- Configured module name mapping for proper workspace package resolution

### 4. Package.json Dependencies
- Verified required Railgun SDK dependencies in railgun-provider package
- Confirmed proper entry points and metadata configuration

### Configuration Files Updated
5. `/sdk/jest.config.js` - Updated to include railgun-wallet mock
6. `/sdk/packages/wallet-connect/jest.config.js` - Fixed moduleNameMapper for railgun provider paths

8. `/workspace/current/sprint.md` - Updated with today's debugging progress

## Test Results Improvement

### Before Today's Work
- **Railgun Provider Tests**: 0/4 passing (all failing)
- **Wallet-Connect Adapter Tests**: 0/5 passing (all failing)
- **Root Cause**: Module resolution errors and missing mocks

### After Today's Work
- **Railgun Provider Tests**: 0/4 passing (still blocked by dependency issues)
- **Wallet-Connect Adapter Tests**: 1/5 passing (improved from 0/5)
- **Root Cause**: Cross-package imports now working, but dependency resolution issues remain

## Current Status

### ✅ What's Working
- Module resolution between wallet-connect and railgun-provider packages
- Cross-package imports functioning correctly
- Mock infrastructure for Railgun SDK components
- Error tracing with improved logging
- Test execution (tests now run, though some still fail)

### ⚠️ Partially Working
- Wallet-connect adapter tests (1/5 passing)
- Error reporting with detailed logging
- Test infrastructure with proper mock setup

### ❌ Still Broken
- All Railgun provider tests still failing due to dependency resolution issues
- Real Railgun SDK integration blocked by initialization requirements
- Database path validation issue preventing engine initialization

### ❌ New Blocking Issue
- Railgun SDK database path validation rejecting "." character in paths
- Error: "Invalid character for wallet source: ."
- Impact: Preventing proper Railgun engine initialization

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Railgun SDK Dependency Resolution
- "Class extends value undefined is not a constructor or null" errors from `@railgun-community/wallet`
- Originates from `wallet-poi-node-interface.ts:30:45` in Railgun SDK internals
- Blocks all Railgun provider test execution (0% coverage)

### Secondary Issue: Railgun Engine Initialization Requirements
- Missing artifact getters required by Railgun engine initialization
- Proper database path configuration needed
- Quick sync function implementation required for initialization

### Tertiary Issue: Database Path Validation (Newly Discovered)
- Railgun SDK validateWalletSource function rejecting paths with "." character
- Preventing proper engine initialization regardless of other fixes
- Requires investigation of acceptable path formats

## Impact of Today's Work

### Improvements Achieved
- Cross-package module resolution now working
- Improved from 0/5 to 1/5 wallet-connect adapter tests passing
- Comprehensive logging for debugging initialization issues
- Mock infrastructure supporting test execution
- Detailed documentation of all changes made

### Remaining Blockers
- Railgun SDK internal dependency errors preventing test execution
- Database path validation preventing engine initialization
- Missing artifact getters required for proper SDK integration

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority
1. Investigate acceptable database path formats for Railgun SDK
2. Implement proper Railgun engine artifact getters
3. Resolve "Class extends value undefined" error in Railgun SDK internals

### Short-term Goals
1. Fix workspace module resolution for @zksdk/railgun-provider package
2. Configure Jest for proper cross-package module name mapping
3. Enable test execution to validate actual SDK functionality

### Long-term Objectives
1. Implement full Railgun engine initialization with artifact getters and quick sync functions
2. Add real proof generation and transaction submission logic
3. Connect to wallet-connect adapter for external wallet integration
4. Achieve full test coverage for Railgun provider functionality

## Knowledge Gaps to Address

### Railgun SDK Specifics
- Exact requirements for artifact getter implementation
- Acceptable database path formats for engine initialization
- Proper implementation of quick sync functions
- Database schema and initialization procedures

### Integration Requirements
- External wallet signing flow specifics
- Session management for long-running operations
- Recovery procedures for interrupted operations

## Session Outcome

### Accomplishments
- ✅ Resolved module resolution issues between packages
- ✅ Improved adapter initialization with better error tracing
- ✅ Created mock infrastructure for testing
- ✅ Documented all changes in dev-hand-off.md
- ✅ Updated sprint progress documentation

### Blockers Identified
- ❌ Railgun SDK internal dependency resolution errors
- ❌ Database path validation preventing engine initialization
- ❌ Missing artifact getters for proper SDK integration

### Overall Assessment
Today's work successfully resolved several integration issues, moving from a state where 0/5 wallet-connect adapter tests were passing to 1/5 now passing. Module resolution errors have been fixed and cross-package imports are now working. However, a new critical issue has been identified with the Railgun SDK's database path validation that is now the primary blocker for initialization.

The debugging work has established a stable foundation with proper error tracing and mock infrastructure in place. The next session should focus on resolving the database path validation issue and implementing the required artifact getters for Railgun engine initialization.
