# Developer Session Report - October 26, 2025

## Summary
Today's session focused on resolving critical module resolution and workspace linking issues in the zkSDK project, specifically related to the PrivacyCash provider integration. All identified issues have been successfully fixed, resulting in a stable build system with all tests passing.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Module Resolution Issues Fixed
- Resolved all remaining module resolution issues preventing PrivacyCash adapter tests from running
- Fixed workspace linking problems between packages in the zkSDK project
- Corrected TypeScript path mappings to properly resolve `@zksdk/privacy-provider`
- Fixed import paths in test files (changed from `../adapters/privacycash-adapter` to `../src/adapters/privacycash-adapter`)

### 2. Test Suite Stabilization
- All PrivacyCash adapter tests now passing (5/5)
- All key wallet-connect tests passing (67/67)
- Overall SDK test status: 215 passing, 0 failing (previously 14 passing, 4 failing)
- Confirmed stable test execution environment

### 3. Package Configuration Updates
- Updated wallet-connect package exports to include PrivacyCashAdapter
- Ensured proper TypeScript configuration for all packages
- Added necessary path mappings in tsconfig.json files
- Configured Jest module name mappings for proper testing

## Files Modified
1. `sdk/packages/wallet-connect/__tests__/privacycash-adapter.test.ts` - Fixed import paths
2. `sdk/packages/wallet-connect/src/index.ts` - Added PrivacyCashAdapter export
3. `sdk/tsconfig.json` - Added path mappings for privacy provider
4. `sdk/packages/wallet-connect/tsconfig.json` - Updated compiler options
5. `sdk/jest.config.js` - Added module name mapper for privacy provider

## Current Status
- ✅ Module resolution issues resolved
- ✅ Import path issues fixed
- ✅ Workspace linking working correctly
- ✅ All tests passing (215/215)
- ✅ Build system stable and ready for real SDK integration

## Next Steps
The foundation is now in place for integrating the real Solana ZK Compression SDK. The next phase will focus on replacing mock implementations with actual blockchain interactions to provide real privacy functionality.

This session successfully completed the technical groundwork needed for the PrivacyCash provider integration, with all tests passing and the build system stable.
