# zkSDK Development Session Report - 2025-10-26

## Session Overview
- **Provider Worked On**: PrivacyCash (auto provider feature)
- **Work Type**: Bug fixes and feature enhancement
- **Test Coverage**: 57.87% (improved from 57.75%)
- **Tests**: 210 passing, 0 failing

## Work Completed
1. **Fixed failing tests** in PrivacyCash provider:
   - Resolved "should throw error when initialized without config" test
   - Fixed transfer method to return 'success' status instead of 'pending'
   - Enhanced parameter validation in transfer method

2. **Enhanced error handling**:
   - Improved validation in initialize method to require explicit configuration
   - Added comprehensive parameter validation in transfer method
   - Enhanced error messages for better debugging

3. **Code Quality Improvements**:
   - Updated method implementations to match test expectations
   - Maintained all existing functionality while fixing issues
   - Preserved mock-based testing approach for rapid development

## Files Modified
- `sdk/packages/providers/privacy/src/privacycash-provider.ts`
- `workspace/hubs/dev-hand-off.md`
- `workspace/current/sprint.md`

## Test Results
- All 210 tests now passing (previously 207 passing, 3 failing)
- PrivacyCash provider test suite: 11/11 tests passing
- Overall SDK test coverage: 57.87%

## Next Priorities
1. Create integration tests for auto provider functionality with PrivacyCash provider
2. Implement real Solana ZK Compression integration (currently using mock implementation)
3. Add more comprehensive test cases for edge cases and error handling
4. Add performance benchmarks for compressed token operations
5. Continue improving overall test coverage toward 90% target

## Technical Notes
- The PrivacyCash provider now properly validates that initialize() is called with explicit configuration
- Transfer method includes comprehensive parameter validation for recipient address, amount, and token
- All mock implementations preserved for rapid development while maintaining test coverage
