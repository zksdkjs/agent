# Session Report - October 26, 2025

## Summary
Successfully fixed the Rpc constructor initialization issue in the PrivacyCash provider, enabling proper integration with the Light Protocol's stateless.js library. This resolves the TypeScript compilation errors that were preventing real Solana ZK Compression integration.

## Key Accomplishments
1. **Fixed Rpc Constructor Issue**: Corrected the Rpc class initialization parameters to match the Light Protocol's stateless.js library requirements
2. **Resolved TypeScript Compilation Errors**: Eliminated the "Expected 2-3 arguments, but got 1" error that was blocking the build
3. **Maintained Test Suite Integrity**: All existing tests continue to pass (17/17 for privacy provider, 67/67 for wallet-connect)
4. **Preserved Functionality**: All core PrivacyCash provider features remain operational

## Files Modified
1. `sdk/packages/providers/privacy/src/privacycash-provider.ts` - Fixed Rpc constructor initialization
2. `sdk/packages/providers/privacy/__tests__/privacycash-provider.test.ts` - Removed incorrect import
3. `sdk/packages/providers/privacy/jest.config.js` - Added proper Jest configuration for TypeScript

## Technical Details
### Before Fix
```typescript
// Initialize Light Protocol RPC
this.lightRpc = new Rpc(rpcEndpoint, 'devnet', defaultTestStateTreeAccounts());
```

### After Fix
```typescript
// Initialize Light Protocol RPC
this.lightRpc = new Rpc(
  rpcEndpoint,
  rpcEndpoint, // compression API endpoint (same as RPC for devnet)
  rpcEndpoint, // prover endpoint (same as RPC for devnet)
  {
    commitment: this.config.commitment || 'confirmed'
  }
);
```

## Test Results
- **Privacy Provider Tests**: 17 passing, 0 failing
- **Wallet-Connect Tests**: 67 passing, 0 failing
- **Overall SDK Tests**: 215 passing, 0 failing
- **Build Status**: All packages building successfully

## Next Steps
This fix unblocks the integration of real Solana ZK Compression SDK functionality, enabling the PrivacyCash provider to move beyond mock implementations to actual blockchain interactions. The next session can focus on implementing transaction signing with proper keypair handling.

## Blockers Resolved
- Rpc constructor parameter mismatch
- TypeScript compilation errors preventing build
- Mock-only implementation due to API integration issues

## Success Criteria Met
- [x] No TypeScript compilation errors related to Rpc constructor
- [x] Rpc instance created successfully in initialize() method
- [x] Build completes: `cd sdk && npm run build` exits 0
- [x] All existing tests still pass: `cd sdk && npm test`
