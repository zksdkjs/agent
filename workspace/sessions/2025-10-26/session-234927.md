# Railgun SDK Integration Session Report - October 26, 2025

## Session Details
- **Date**: October 26, 2025
- **Duration**: 4 hours
- **Participants**: Development Team

## Objectives
- Replace mock Railgun SDK implementation in zkSDK with real Railgun SDK functionality
- Establish working integration with wallet-connect adapter
- Achieve initial test execution with real SDK functions

## Progress Summary
- Completed foundational architecture for Railgun provider implementation
- Implemented multi-network support (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum)
- Integrated wallet-connect adapter structure
- All tests currently failing due to import/dependency resolution issues

## Key Accomplishments
- ✅ Complete Railgun provider architecture with real SDK integration points
- ✅ Multi-network support for 6 EVM networks (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum)
- ✅ Wallet-connect adapter integration structure completed
- ✅ Method signatures compliant with BasePrivacyProvider interface
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and validation implemented
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Created detailed documentation including test results and handoff documents

## Issues Encountered
- ❌ All 4 Railgun provider test suites failing due to dependency resolution
- ❌ "Class extends value undefined is not a constructor or null" errors from @railgun-community/wallet
- ❌ 0% test coverage preventing validation of actual functionality
- ❌ Real SDK functions not executable due to initialization requirements
- ❌ Module resolution issues preventing wallet-connect adapter tests from running

## Solutions Implemented
- ✅ Created comprehensive architectural foundation following established patterns
- ✅ Implemented proper network mapping functions for all supported EVM networks
- ✅ Developed wallet-connect adapter with proper method delegation
- ✅ Established proper TypeScript typing and error handling throughout
- ✅ Created detailed documentation for handoff and future work

## Next Steps
1. Resolve Railgun SDK dependency issues preventing test execution
2. Fix import errors with @railgun-community/wallet and @railgun-community/engine
3. Implement proper Railgun engine initialization with artifact getters
4. Add real proof generation and transaction submission logic
5. Connect to wallet-connect adapter for external wallet integration
6. Update Jest configuration for proper workspace module resolution

## Action Items
- [ ] Investigate and resolve @railgun-community/wallet import errors ("Class extends value undefined" issue)
- [ ] Implement Railgun engine initialization with required artifact getters
- [ ] Configure Jest for workspace module resolution
- [ ] Enable real transaction processing functionality with actual SDK integration
- [ ] Fix module resolution for @zksdk/railgun-provider in wallet-connect adapter

## Test Results Summary
- **Railgun Provider Tests**: 0/4 passing (all failing due to dependency issues)
- **Wallet-Connect Adapter Tests**: 1/5 passing (privacycash reference only)
- **Root Cause**: Dependency resolution errors blocking all functional validation
