# Developer Session Report - zkSDK Auto Provider Feature
Date: 2025-10-26

## Summary
Completed work on fixing module resolution and workspace linking issues that were preventing PrivacyCash adapter tests from running. All previously failing tests are now passing, and the build system is stable.

## Key Accomplishments
1. **Fixed Module Resolution Issues** - Resolved TypeScript path mapping issues that prevented the PrivacyCash adapter from importing the privacy provider
2. **Corrected Test Import Paths** - Fixed relative import paths in the PrivacyCash adapter test file
3. **Configured Jest Module Mappers** - Added proper module name mappings for Jest testing
4. **Updated Package Exports** - Ensured PrivacyCashAdapter is properly exported from wallet-connect package
5. **Verified Test Execution** - All PrivacyCash adapter tests (5/5) now pass
6. **Confirmed Overall System Stability** - All SDK tests (215/215) passing

## Files Modified
1. `sdk/packages/wallet-connect/__tests__/privacycash-adapter.test.ts` - Fixed import path
2. `sdk/packages/wallet-connect/src/index.ts` - Added PrivacyCashAdapter export
3. `sdk/tsconfig.json` - Added path mappings for privacy provider
4. `sdk/packages/wallet-connect/tsconfig.json` - Updated compiler options and path mappings
5. `sdk/jest.config.js` - Added module name mapper for privacy provider

## Test Results
- PrivacyCash adapter tests: 5 passing, 0 failing (previously 0 passing, 1 failing due to import issues)
- Key wallet-connect tests: 67 passing, 0 failing (previously 14 passing, 4 failing)
- Overall SDK tests: 215 passing, 0 failing

## Coverage
- Wallet-connect package: 88.42% statements
- Privacy provider package: 81.35% statements

## Current Status
All module resolution and workspace linking issues have been resolved. The build system is stable and all tests are passing. The foundation is now in place for integrating the real Solana ZK Compression SDK.

## Next Session Focus
Integrate real Solana ZK Compression SDK to replace mock implementations with actual blockchain interactions.
