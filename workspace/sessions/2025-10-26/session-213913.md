# zkSDK Development Session Report
**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Session ID:** 213913  
**Focus:** Railgun EVM Privacy - Recipe→Step→ComboMeal Pattern Implementation

## Summary
Completed foundational work on the Recipe→Step→ComboMeal pattern implementation for Railgun EVM privacy functionality within the zkSDK framework. Established the new `@zksdk/recipes` package with core types and a basic RecipeExecutor implementation. This work sets the stage for future integration with the actual Railgun provider.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. New Recipes Package Creation
- Created `@zksdk/recipes` package with complete directory structure
- Configured package.json with proper dependencies and metadata
- Set up tsconfig.json for TypeScript compilation
- Organized source code with modular structure

### 2. Core Type Definitions
Implemented comprehensive type definitions in `sdk/packages/recipes/src/core/types.ts`:
- `Recipe`: High-level privacy workflow container
- `Step`: Individual operation within a recipe
- `ComboMeal`: Bundle of recipes that work together
- `RecipeContext`: Execution context for managing state
- `RecipeConfig`: Configuration options for recipe execution
- `RecipeResult`: Standardized result format for recipe execution
- `StepResult`: Standardized result format for individual step execution

### 3. RecipeExecutor Implementation
Built foundational RecipeExecutor class in `sdk/packages/recipes/src/core/executor.ts` with capabilities for:
- Sequential execution of recipe steps
- Context management for sharing data between steps
- Error handling with configurable error callbacks
- Support for multiple step types:
  - Transfer operations
  - Balance checks
  - Proof generation
  - Transaction submission
  - Custom operations
- ComboMeal execution for complex workflow orchestration

### 4. Documentation
- Created detailed `workspace/hubs/railgun-hand-off.md` documenting:
  - Package structure and design decisions
  - Implementation details of core components
  - Usage examples for future developers
  - Next steps for integration with Railgun provider
  - Planned enhancements for advanced features

## Files Created/Modified
1. `sdk/packages/recipes/package.json` - New recipes package configuration
2. `sdk/packages/recipes/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration for recipes package
3. `sdk/packages/recipes/src/core/types.ts` - Core type definitions for Recipe→Step→ComboMeal pattern
4. `sdk/packages/recipes/src/core/executor.ts` - Basic RecipeExecutor implementation
5. `sdk/packages/recipes/src/core/index.ts` - Core module exports
6. `workspace/hubs/railgun-hand-off.md` - Comprehensive documentation of Railgun EVM Privacy progress

## Current Status
✅ Recipe→Step→ComboMeal pattern foundation established  
✅ New recipes package created with proper structure  
✅ Core types and interfaces defined  
✅ Basic RecipeExecutor implementation complete  
✅ Package configuration working  
✅ Comprehensive documentation created  

⚠️ Integration with actual Railgun provider in progress  
⚠️ Real step implementations in progress  
⚠️ Testing and validation pending  
⚠️ Advanced features (parallel execution, retry mechanisms) pending

### RecipeExecutor Capabilities
The RecipeExecutor class provides foundational functionality for executing privacy workflows:
- Sequential step execution with timing metrics
- Context management for sharing data between steps
- Error handling with customizable error callbacks
- Support for different step action types
- ComboMeal execution for orchestrating complex workflows

### Current Limitations
The current implementation is designed as a foundation:
- Uses simulated (mock) implementations for all step actions
- Basic error handling without retry mechanisms
- No parallel execution capabilities
- Limited configuration options

## Next Critical Actions

### 1. Railgun Provider Integration
- Connect RecipeExecutor to actual Railgun provider methods
- Replace mock implementations with real Railgun operations
- Implement proof generation and verification steps
- Add transaction submission capabilities

### 2. Enhanced Functionality
- Implement parallel step execution for performance optimization
- Add retry mechanisms with configurable retry counts
- Implement dependency management between steps
- Add more sophisticated error handling and recovery

### 3. Testing and Validation
- Create comprehensive unit tests for RecipeExecutor
- Develop integration tests with Railgun provider
- Validate ComboMeal execution with complex workflows
- Performance benchmarking and optimization

### 4. Documentation and Examples
- Create detailed developer guides for Recipe→Step→ComboMeal pattern
- Add practical usage examples for common privacy workflows
- Document best practices for recipe design
- Create API documentation for all core components

## Future Vision
The Recipe→Step→ComboMeal pattern is designed to:
- Provide a standardized approach to privacy workflow execution
- Enable complex multi-step privacy operations with proper orchestration
- Support multiple privacy providers beyond Railgun
- Allow for both simple and complex privacy workflows
- Facilitate testing and validation of privacy operations
- Enable performance optimization through parallel execution

This foundation enables future developers to build upon a solid base for implementing sophisticated privacy-preserving operations in the zkSDK ecosystem.
