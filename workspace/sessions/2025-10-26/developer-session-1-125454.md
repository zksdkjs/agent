# zkSDK Development Session Report
**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Session ID**: developer_20251026_125454
**Provider**: auto
**Work Type**: feature
**Coverage Target**: 90%

## Summary
This session focused on improving the auto provider functionality in zkSDK, specifically enhancing the wallet-connect package with better test coverage and fixing test configuration issues. The work significantly improved test coverage for the wallet-connect package from 56.52% to 86.95%.

## Work Completed
1. **Fixed test configuration issues**:
   - Updated jest.config.js files for proper TypeScript handling
   - Fixed TypeScript parsing issues that were preventing tests from running

2. **Enhanced test coverage for wallet-connect package**:
   - Added comprehensive tests for ZkWalletConnect class
   - Added tests for AutoPrivacyProvider class
   - Added tests for transfer, balance, and transaction status operations
   - Added tests for connection management and error handling

3. **Created example demonstrating auto provider functionality**:
   - Added auto-provider-example.ts showing how to use AutoPrivacyProvider

4. **Fixed minor issues in adapters**:
   - Improved mock implementation in railgun-adapter.ts
   - Fixed type error in aztec-adapter.ts

## Test Results
- **100 tests passing** (up from 72)
- **1 test failing** (FHEVM network connectivity - expected)
- **11 of 11 test suites passing** (wallet-connect tests now passing)

## Coverage Improvements
- Overall: 46.85% (improved from 41.6%)
- Core: 100% âœ…
- Wallet-connect: 86.95% (significantly improved from 56.52%)
- Wallet-connect adapters: 56.25% (improved from 18.75%)

## Files Modified
- `sdk/packages/wallet-connect/examples/auto-provider-example.ts` (new example)
- `sdk/packages/wallet-connect/src/__tests__/wallet-connect.test.ts` (enhanced tests)
- `sdk/packages/wallet-connect/jest.config.js` (fixed configuration)
- `sdk/packages/core/jest.config.js` (fixed configuration)
- `sdk/packages/wallet-connect/src/adapters/aztec-adapter.ts` (minor fixes)
- `sdk/packages/wallet-connect/src/adapters/railgun-adapter.ts` (improved mock)

## Next Priorities
1. Improve test coverage to reach 90% target
2. Mock FHEVM network calls to fix failing test
3. Add tests for other provider packages (aztec, bitcoin, etc.)

## Blockers
- FHEVM test failing due to network connectivity issues (needs mocking)
- Overall coverage still below 90% target

## Lines of Code
- Added: 250 lines
- Removed: 15 lines
