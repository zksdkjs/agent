# Genesis Phase - Autonomous Agent Self-Construction

## Overview
**Phase:** Genesis - Agents Build Themselves
**Goal:** Goose agents autonomously create their own development system using Goose + Claude Code + Minimax research
**Timeline:** Week 1-2
**Approach:** Let agents ask questions, make decisions, and build their own infrastructure

## Genesis Mandate for Agents

**Your Mission:** Build yourselves into a fully autonomous zkSDK development system.

### Genesis Task 1: Self-Analysis and Planning
**Agent Questions to Ask:**
- What folder structure do we need for autonomous operation?
- How should we organize our own recipes and plans?
- What development tools and workflows do we need?
- How should we coordinate between different agent types?
- What's the best way to integrate Goose + Claude Code + existing research?

**Agent Deliverables:**
- Propose your own folder structure
- Create your own detailed sub-plans
- Design your own coordination system
- Set up your own development environment

### Genesis Task 2: Infrastructure Creation
**Agent Decisions to Make:**
- Which dependencies should we install?
- How should we structure the monorepo?
- What testing frameworks should we use?
- How should we handle secrets and configuration?
- What CI/CD pipeline do we need?

**Agent Deliverables:**
- Set up complete development environment
- Create package.json files and dependencies
- Implement testing and building infrastructure
- Configure security and secrets management

### Genesis Task 3: Research Integration
**Agent Research Tasks:**
- Analyze all Minimax research in `minimax-m1-agent-space`
- Prioritize which privacy systems to implement first
- Create implementation roadmaps based on research findings
- Identify gaps in research that need filling

**Agent Questions:**
- Which privacy systems are most production-ready?
- What are the integration complexity rankings?
- Which systems should we start with for fastest MVP?
- What additional research do we need to conduct?

## Phase Progression

### Phase 1: Genesis - Self-Building (Week 1-2)
**Agent Autonomy Level:** High
**Human Input:** High-level approval/rejection only

**Agent Tasks:**
- Build complete development infrastructure
- Create their own detailed implementation plans
- Set up autonomous coordination systems
- Integrate existing research and create new research tasks
- Design their own quality assurance processes

**Human Role:**
- Answer clarifying questions when agents ask
- Approve/reject major architectural decisions
- Provide feedback on agent proposals

### Phase 2: GitHub Release & Testing (Week 3)
**Agent Autonomy Level:** Very High  
**Human Input:** Release approval only

**Agent Tasks:**
- Prepare repository for public GitHub release
- Create comprehensive README and documentation
- Implement small-scale testing with basic functionality
- Set up automated testing and CI/CD
- Create initial marketing materials

**Agent Decisions:**
- What should the public repository look like?
- How should we structure our testing approach?
- What level of functionality should be in the first release?
- How should we handle community feedback and contributions?

### Phase 3: Core Integration + Marketing Automation (Week 4-8)
**Agent Autonomy Level:** Maximum
**Human Input:** Strategic guidance only

**Agent Tasks:**
- Integrate 4 core privacy systems autonomously
- Create and execute marketing plan automatically
- Develop GTM strategy and execute
- Build community engagement automation
- Set up automated documentation and blog generation

**Systems to Integrate (Agent Choice):**
- Agents research and decide which 4 systems based on:
  - Production readiness
  - Integration complexity  
  - Market demand
  - Technical feasibility

### Phase 4: 24/7 Autonomous Operation (Week 9+)
**Agent Autonomy Level:** Full Autonomy
**Human Input:** Occasional strategic oversight

**Continuous Agent Operations:**

**Development Agent (24/7):**
- Continuous zkSDK development and improvement
- Bug fixes and performance optimization
- New feature implementation
- Code quality maintenance

**Research Agent (Daily):**
- Monitor privacy ecosystem developments
- Track new privacy protocols and updates
- Analyze competitor movements
- Update implementation priorities based on market changes

**Marketing Agent (Daily):**
- Social media content generation
- Blog post creation and publishing
- Community engagement
- Partnership outreach automation

**Quality Agent (Continuous):**
- Automated testing and validation
- Security monitoring and updates
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Documentation maintenance

**Strategy Agent (Weekly):**
- Market analysis and strategy updates
- Priority reassessment based on ecosystem changes
- Resource allocation optimization
- Long-term planning and roadmap updates

## Agent Coordination Framework

### Decision-Making Process
1. **Individual Agent Analysis:** Each agent researches and proposes solutions
2. **Cross-Agent Discussion:** Agents discuss proposals and trade-offs
3. **Consensus Building:** Agents reach agreement on approach
4. **Human Checkpoint:** Major decisions presented for approval/rejection
5. **Implementation:** Agents execute approved plans
6. **Iteration:** Agents refine based on implementation learnings

### Communication Patterns
- **Daily Updates:** Progress reports and blocker identification
- **Strategic Reviews:** Weekly priority and direction alignment  
- **Emergency Escalation:** Immediate human input for critical decisions
- **Learning Sharing:** Cross-agent knowledge sharing and best practices
