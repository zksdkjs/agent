# zkSDK - The LangChain of Privacy

A unified SDK for privacy-preserving operations across multiple privacy systems.

## Vision

zkSDK provides a single interface for developers to integrate privacy-preserving operations into their applications, abstracting away the complexity of different privacy systems (Railgun, Zeto, Aztec, etc.).

## Architecture Overview

```

## Core Concepts

### 1. Providers (Like LangChain LLMs)
Each privacy system is implemented as a provider with a unified interface.

### 2. Operations (Like LangChain Tools)
Standard privacy operations: transfer, swap, vote, compute, etc.

### 3. Recipes (Like LangChain Chains)
Pre-built patterns combining operations for common use cases.

### 4. Steps (Like LangChain Prompts)
Atomic units of privacy operations.

### 5. Wallet Connect (Like WalletConnect for Privacy)
Unified wallet interface that makes it easy to connect to any privacy provider.
