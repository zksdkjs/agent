# zkSDK Agent Workspace

This repository houses the autonomous workspace that designs, researches, and ships the zkSDK (“the LangChain of Privacy”). It combines planning artefacts, research outputs, TypeScript source code, and Goose automation so every agent and human shares the same ground truth.

## Core References

- [`docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md`](./HOW-IT-WORKS.md) — human-oriented walkthrough of folders and day-to-day flow.
- [`docs/AGENT-PIPELINE.md`](./docs/AGENT-PIPELINE.md) — definitive map of scripts, recipes, read/write paths, and hand-offs.
- [`strategy/active/current.md`](./strategy/active/current.md) — symlink to the active plan generated by the Product Manager agent.
- [`workspace/hubs/`](./workspace/hubs) — latest research, strategy, dev, and docs summaries shared between agents.

## Daily Workflow (hub operator or Claude Code terminal)

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/agent/privacy-agent

# 0. (optional) start a fresh session scaffold
./automation/scripts/start-new-session.sh

# 1. Research → product strategy
./automation/scripts/daily-run-strategy.sh

# 2. Developer implementation + optional daily report
./automation/scripts/daily-run-dev.sh            # add --no-report to skip the summary

# 3. Marketing/docs update (requires ../zk-landing clone)
DOC_SITE_ROOT=../zk-landing \
  ./automation/scripts/run-doc-site-writer.sh --scope weekly
```

These scripts automatically regenerate context, refresh the hub files, write outputs into `insights/`, `strategy/`, `sdk/`, and update the marketing repo. Review `workspace/hubs/*.md` after each run and commit changes in both repos as needed.

## Repository Layout (Framework V2)

```
privacy-agent/
├── automation/         # Shell wrappers and Goose recipes
├── docs/               # Internal documentation (pipeline, architecture, flows)
├── insights/           # Immutable research & daily reports
├── strategy/           # Roadmaps, product deliverables, ADRs
├── workspace/          # Live sprint data, sessions, hub hand-offs, memory
├── sdk/                # TypeScript workspace for the actual zkSDK packages
└── .goose/             # Recipes, rules, context bundles, and hints
```

Additional clones:
- `../zk-landing/` — public-facing docs + landing site updated by `run-doc-site-writer.sh`.
- `privacy-cash-sdk/`, `goose/` — upstream/vendor repos kept locally (consider moving to submodules if space is an issue).

## Key Automation Scripts

| Script | Purpose | Primary Outputs |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| `automation/scripts/prepare-context.sh` | Build `.goose/data/context/current-session.md` from workspace state | Context bundle |
| `automation/scripts/daily-run-strategy.sh` | Orchestrate market research then product strategy | `insights/research/pm-market-research-*.md`, `strategy/product/*`, `workspace/hubs/research-latest.md`, `workspace/hubs/strategy-hand-off.md` |
| `automation/scripts/daily-run-dev.sh` | Run developer agent (plus optional report) | Code in `sdk/**`, `workspace/sessions/…`, `workspace/hubs/dev-hand-off.md`, `insights/daily/YYYY/MM/DD/daily-summary.md` |
| `automation/scripts/run-doc-site-writer.sh` | Publish weekly/daily marketing updates to zk-landing | `../zk-landing/docs/zksdkjs/updates/*.mdx`, refreshed overview copy, `workspace/hubs/docs-hand-off.md` |
| `automation/scripts/generate-daily-report.sh` | Aggregate the day’s session notes | `insights/daily/YYYY/MM-DD/daily-summary.md` |

Full details, including recipe bindings, live in [`docs/AGENT-PIPELINE.md`](./docs/AGENT-PIPELINE.md).

## Outputs & Hand-Offs

- **Research:** `insights/research/pm-market-research-YYYY-MM-DD.md` + `workspace/hubs/research-latest.md`
- **Product Strategy:** `strategy/product/*.md` + `workspace/hubs/strategy-hand-off.md`
- **Engineering:** source changes in `sdk/`, notes in `workspace/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD/`, summary in `workspace/hubs/dev-hand-off.md`
- **Marketing/Docs:** `../zk-landing/docs/zksdkjs/updates/*.mdx`, refreshed `../zk-landing/docs/zksdkjs/*.md`, summary in `workspace/hubs/docs-hand-off.md`
- **Pipeline Audit:** `workspace/hubs/pipeline-log.md`

## Keeping Things Current

1. Run the daily scripts above (or the wrapped commands in your automation environment).
2. Review and commit changes in this repo and `zk-landing` after each run.
3. Update `strategy/roadmap/` and ADRs when the PM generates new direction.
4. Archive legacy directories (`plans/`, `reports/`, root `memory/`) once all links point to the canonical locations.

For deeper context on architecture, integration flows, and provider status, see the documents under `docs/` and the outputs in `strategy/product/`.
